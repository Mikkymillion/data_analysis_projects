Copper bracelets.
Had a family friend in the 90s who was involved in a copper health products MLM. Do I get double points?
"Yes, if you sign up five more people"
">Washington, D.C. - November 8, 2019 - A new study has found that copper hospital beds in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) harbored an average of 95 percent fewer bacteria than conventional hospital beds, and maintained these low-risk levels throughout patients’ stay in hospital. The research is published this week in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, a journal of the American Society for Microbiology.

"Yes. The antimicrobial power of copper is well known but that’s not what the MLM group was selling. They claimed arthritis improves and my family friend claimed her husband’s cataplexy and narcolepsy improved when sleeping on a mattress embedded with copper. There was a magnetic component in there, too. (IK copper is not magnetic. I may have some details wrong - it’s been decades and I thought it was BS at the time."
Those were obviously a scam.  I only buy ionic bracelets.
Nah bro! Those hologram stickers beat them hands down in that study the aliens did that got suppressed by the government and pharma bros.
Have fun with wrist cancer!
"lol. I love these ads. I've never bought one, but every time I see an ad for one...bracelets, socks, shirts, whatever...I sit there and think, ""shit, that is exactly what I need.""

lol."
"I had a few because they were pretty (Celtic knotwork engraving), and when I stopped wearing bracelets because they got in the way of the keyboard and cash register, I developed tendinitis in my wrists!  Coincidence?  I think so!  I mean, it couldn’t have anything to do with being a full-time college student while also working 30-35 hours a week as a cashier, right?  (Do I really need to add the /s?)"
"> Do I really need to add the /s?

No. And if anyone ever doesn't get it without the /s, you block them and are happy to know there's one less user not ever worth dealing with."
All of my golfer friends and wore these in the 90s.  That green stain on our wrists showed how serious we were about the game.
Ea Nasir is still at his old ways.
Nanni is a legend.
"Nothing upsets me more than making jewelry with copper and seeing people in the same market making the same thing but adding, “healing properties” or “natural healing remedy” to their website/shop/jewelry listings. It’s predatory behavior and I guarantee 99% of them don’t believe it themselves."
Some of them are cool looking though.
"If you want cool looking jewelry, buy jewelry. But the scam is that a lot of people buy these for more money or at all specifically because of the promise of health benefits. That's textbook false advertising and every single one of these companies should have all assets seized"
...and non stick pans.
Surely you don’t mean the impugn the stellar reputation of the Chi Chi Rodriguez Magnetic Golf Bracelet!
An oldie!
I got some good ones from an acquaintance named Ea-nāṣir. No complaints so far.
But have you seen the copper sheets for your bed??????
Hahahah yo I just snorted  on that one.  So true
Those sites that make you do hours of work by downloading shady apps and watching endless ads just to get you 20% of the way to getting a $5 target gift card
"Prize rebel. I was 12 years old, and gave my newly built computer every form of digital STD imaginable. Lesson learned."
When I was 12 I really did earn $20 answering marketing surveys from an old site called inboxdollars. I had to explain to my mom why I was mailed a check. Sounds like an area rife for scamming today
Been an area rife with scams since the Late 00's.
"Women, relationships, kids — why even bother..?"
name fits
Yeah I made $100 from doing surveys but I stopped because it was just the biggest pain in the ass I'd rather be raking leaves and mowing lawns.
Made 0.6 Bitcoins filling out 2 surveys. was worth maybe $0.10 at the time. Sold in Dec 2020...
"i have been talking to robots for about a year now.  have made 100$ish for a few hours of forecasting.

trying to get more gigs but they fill up quick."
You talk to robots for money?
I think they must be talking about training A.I. From what I have read it pays well. It’s usually always work from home.
"It does pay well (depending on where you live), but it's not consistent work.

I do it on the side for around $18 an hour when I'm bored and there's work available, some of the work is fun, some of the work is very painstakingly boring.

I will say it's neat to see an AI ""grow"".

Nearly all of the AI training is under NDA's, so it's hard to give any more information, but if you like typing/researching and are looking for a side gig, I recommend it."
How do you do this??? any sites????
Sorry I don't know any platforms that are currently recruiting. I'm not looking for new work at the moment so I don't keep up to date as well as I probably should.
"yup.

not much money but easy work.  they ask you to look at data and then write out how you would extrapolate it.  then the robots study everyone's answers and come back at a later meeting and ask the question again but this time they have crafted the question using the answers from the first round...  and so on.

i parsed the same data 4 times over the summer and each time the questions came back a bit cleaner and direct."
What's the site? I may be interested in training AI
"InboxDollars did work for a while, but the amount of time you spent on it, was not worth what they sent you."
It was usually always a scam but you needed more than 1 device and to be there early to make a lot of money. For example I made almost $10k in a year just babysitting a bunch of devices. I built 2 computers from those sites.
I did inboxdollars back in the day!
I remember that! Got a $30 gift card from them.
I got $60 from them! Loved that site when I had nothing else to do
"When I was 12, my friends and I would make $2-$3 answering surveys at the mall, $5 at absolute most (and that was a one off).
An adult would seek out teenagers, bring them back to some back office room, ask 10-20 questions, pay them and send them on their way."
i used to rack up frequent flyer miles on inbox dollars. like I was actually taking a trip a month. (my job had a lot of downtime.) probably can't do that anymore.
"Hey inboxdollars is legit!! It's a time suck, but if you're desperate, it's something!!"
"Remember trying out one of those as a high schooler to try to get a free iPod touch lol. Yea….didn’t make it far. Wish I had “fallen” for bitcoin instead, but my shitty instinct told me that was a scam."
"Me being 16 and watching a bitcoin documentary about it and saw I could by 1 bitcoin for 50 cents after watching it and saw the potential. But not being old enough for PayPal or a credit card I couldn’t do shit. 

Guess what exploded when I turned 18?"
"I mean, to be fair, if it were 50 cents while you were 16, then when you were 18, it was probably still very cheap. But in your defense, even if it were like 50-100 bucks by then, who could’ve guessed that it would reach tens of thousands of dollars? very few people did. Guess we can all just take solice in the fact that we probably would’ve sold looong before the peak even if we did get bitcoin at sub $1000."
"If I recall the times correctly it was steadily on the rise and someone who was actually paying attention to it would have seen it coming. By the time I was 19 is when the first boom happened but sadly I was not paying attention to it after not being able to buy it when I first learned about it and having forgot about it. 

But you correct about all of that, none of us knew who the fuck knew."
Most crypto is more or less a scam in fairness.
"I remember reading about it in my apartment in grad school when it hit I think $3. I even had the right hardware to be able to mine something back then (a Radeon 4770). But then I hit the part where oh it's not just downloading the wallet you need to set up the miner, ""well whatever the ship must have already sailed if I'm reading about it in the mainstream non-tech press"". :(

Later fucked around with dogecoin mining for fun a couple of years later and was retroactively kicking myself for being lazy that day, getting the doge mining set up (so I assume bitcoin mining would have been similar effort) turned out to right about the same level of effort as flashing custom Android ROMs, which I did a lot of in grad school. Even similar pain points like finding a good guide you feel confident about following potentially taking more time than actually following the guide.

The real question of course is how long would any of us have held. A lot of us would have definitely sold the first time it hit $100. Maybe an easier decision to just wait and see if you only had a couple of coins but if you had even 1,000 coins when it hits $100 are you really gonna hold?"
"Exactly. I bet a MOST early investors sold at less than $200, especially if they couldn’t envision its potential. I definitely would’ve been one of those sellers even if I’d gotten into it early. 100k would be life changing money to me even now. I only know of like a handful of publicized people who got into it early and never sold until they were rich rich. One of those people is that black guy on YouTube who was practically begging people to buy even just one….when it was at less than $10. (Think it was in 2012 or something). And it seems to me a lot of earlier investors who held a long time or are still holding were already not even close to broke to begin with. Read of a guy who put like 12k into bitcoin early on, and then “forgot” about it till like 2021…..like who else but the already “comfortable” can invest 12k into something and just forget about it like it’s a 10er in your old wallet?"
Digital STD is amazing 😂😂👏
"Haha, that's the site i used too. While it's shady and not at all worth your time, i did find it rather helpful. When I was a teen, i was too young to get a bank account and my mom was deathly opposed to buying anything online, so I used PR to buy a few minecraft key codes for me and a couple friends. Which led to a 8 year addiction to the game & joining a community that i still play with and consider my closest friends. To me it was well worth the 3 months of time wasting ""work"" filling out hundreds of surveys, but I'd never recommend it to anyone as an actual source of income. 

At least i was somewhat smart about it though (and probably broke half of PR's T&C). I used an alias, fake address (i checked to make sure there wasn't actually a house there), an old prepaid cell phone, an old laptop i didn't care about, a sandboxed browser, antivirus, antimalware, public wifi, the works. The computer was getting multiple viruses every time I used it, and i just kept the phone off because it was getting so many spam calls and texts lol."
Lmfao this is hilarious 🤣🤣 STD's everywhere
My brother used prize rebel and saved up enough to buy the 3ds and said never again months of grinding.maybe even years
"I got a few things off of that site.


15 years later I'm still getting spam emails from it lol"
"damn, blast from the past"
🤣🤣🤣
"When I was younger (I think right around 14 y/o), there was a service that would pay you if you went to McDonalds, order a meal, write your experience and submit that. It did actually work: I got my meal payed for and I think around 8$ of compensation. But the whole process was such a pita that it was never worth it."
I got my copy of The Orange Box from prize rebel when I was a teen lmao
Why didn't you just use a VM to test everything in? Malware preventative solution - check ✅ 
"There used to exist community forums where you could outsource this work.

You may remember the “WIN AN XBOX 360” or similar, and you’d do an offer and be told you needed to get other people to complete “1 platinum offer” or “4 gold offers” or “10 bronze offers.”

And everybody thought it was a scam you couldn’t win - except you 100% could, and people did.

People built whole forums around trading offers with other people - they would workout the prize cost, let’s say $500, and offer people money to confirm/do offers for them.

As a poor college kid I made a decent amount of extra spending cash just helping people by getting a free month of Netflix, or paying $1 on a trial at X stupid website."
"Not sure if they still do, but Amazon had a site around 2012-2015 where you could go to do all sorts of basic nonsense tasks like rating images, answering surveys, etc. Most of them paid pennies, but you could filter by award amount and get some that paid 25-50 cents, or even a dollar or more sometimes. Usually for just a couple seconds of work.

Not a massive game changer, but as a broke college kid, sitting on my laptop burning 20-30 minutes on it here and there paid for a McChicken or two per week, as well as my monthly runescape subscription. Lol"
Amazon Turk!  Haven't done it in a while but it can be good if you're tech savvy enough!
*Mechanical* Turk is what it was called
That's the one! Still around? Been YEARS since I was doing it haha
Yes but it's not as lucrative. If you invested a lot of time into it and learned to work the system you could make $5000 a month.
I have no idea. I've fortunately been able to pick myself up for the most part enough to not have to rely on these types of sites anymore.
I think AI has ruined MTurk. I haven't' done anything there in two years. Just not worth it anymore.
Yes but people in India will do the same work cheaper than you.
"That's the point,  its a digital sweatshop like fiver and a lot of other ""freelance"" websites"
"I was going to try and get invite for Amazon Vine where they send you stuff and you review it. 

I have never heard of Amazon Turk. May not be as good back in the day. Any decent rewards or just bleh today?"
"Most of the stuff on Vine are junk now. Plus you have to pay taxes on what you got for free, you have to reach 100 items with like 90% reviewed in 6 months to get to ""gold"" where you get items above $100. I got some decent things from Vine that I was able to sell on Market place but it became more work than it was worth."
"Hey yeah, how do those people get free products for a ""paid review "" on Amazon? I buy a f××k ton of stuff from Amazon."
"To my knowledge, they reach out to you. In order to get them to do that... just start posting reviews on things you've bought. videos, photos, long review or short review. Just post a review. The other commenter said the products are junk nowadays. Plus you have to report the product on your taxes."
"Well, screw that!"
Mechanical Turk!  I did this a lot as a postdoc because I made a really low salary despite having a PhD.  I was able to make about $200.
200 in how long?
Over probably a few months.  I know likely wasn’t great return on time but it was nice to have a bit of extra money.
A week or a month?
Over a couple of months.  I can’t remember exactly it’s been so long.  I made so little money as a postdoc that extra money felt awesome
Med students suffer unless their parents are comfortable.
Postdocs aren’t med students.  We have a PhD but are working as a researcher.  My salary then was 41k in 2014.
"My bad. I think I knew this... once, lol. I'm 73 and my memory is just super bad lately. That's OK, there's a lot I want to forget!"
"MTurk! I did that when I was a stay at home mom.  It was kind of fun, just a bit of extra spending money."
"Right? Most of it i just idly clicked through, and it was nice to have extra cash when I was a college kid haha"
"I used to hire people like you to e.g., write video game reviews when I was trying to bootstrap UGC websites. It was a great deal on both sides. 

Amazon used to call it ""artificial artificial intelligence"". 😂 (Real name was mechanical Turk/MTurk. The name has sort of an interesting story about an apocryphal chess playing robot.)

BTW if you still want that kind of work now, try DataAnnotation.tech or remotasks."
"MTurk helped me buy so many books on Amazon.  I found an awesome, $0.10 to type in info from a business card into forms.  Way easy, and bought so many books!"
I did MTurk after I got divorced. Did it in my spare time and earned several thousand dollars a year. It was boring but legit work. It paid for my vacations for a few years.
"That was my stepdads first side “job” after getting his work visa.  
He bought my little sister her second car seat with the money he made with it"
"Mechanical Turk. I remember doing some of those for hours and it was a lot of ""select all images with a bus"" and I think I topped out at $10 and never did it again."
"That shit went downhill fast. I joined it a bit late, and the payouts were minuscule to the point of not being worth it at all"
it is still there and can still earn some side cash on it [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/worker/how-it-works)
"It existed well before that, too. In like 2005 they had you look up album art and enter the album title as some sort of seed to get people using it.  The issue was the ASIN was in the album cover URI so you could just extract that and do a quick API lookup to grab the title then fill it. I had that fully automated in like 20 minutes. Even had a watcher on page state to grab the next task, but only for album art. I don’t even think they had captcha at that point. 

That paid for a LOT of fun on Amazon with all the gift cards."
They still do. Except there are not as many tasks anymore.
Sounds like Mechanical Turk.
Paid work to train AI models for machine vision! That you for feeding our soon-to-be AI overlords.
"Mechanical Turk still exists. In fact, stuff like that is a lot of the basis for ""AI"" that's not actually AI."
"Mechanical Turk still exists. In fact, stuff like that is a lot of the basis for ""AI"" that's not actually AI."
Mechanical Turk.... that's what it's called
I used MTurk in college. I would try and make like $100 a week. Sometimes I’d make more. One time I hit the jackpot and landed a $100 turk.
"During covid I did this exact thing for a site called Swagbucks, really good micro work for beer money, and got 1200 each for me, my wife and 2 friends.  I wouldn't honestly trust it from anywhere else but I had been using this site for some time when this offer became available."
"I've been on swagbucks for about 10 years i think...sometimes more active than other times.  I've done a lot of their surveys (I don't anymore) but most recently I've been playing games, that's seemed to pay well. And using the cash back; the last time we traveled i got about 10% back on our hotel stay!"
Yes what made me the most money was playing the apps that were games and signing up for bank accounts.  Though now the game thing has gotten a little more... intuitive than it was before to complete the requirements to get paid but 100% worth it if you can complete it within the time limit.
I recall doing FB games when it was slow at work for Swagbucks and getting like $50 for passing the time playing simulation games in the early days. I honestly thought this is all a scam until I got the payouts.
I've been on Swagbucks since 2012? I reached the 2nd highest tier at some point which was a $150 reward. I think I used to make like $500/mo off that site when they had all the mobile apps. Swagbucks and Perk paid for the parts of my first gaming pc build 100% in under 6 months.
"Back in the early 360 era there were those ""Type in the code from a soda bottlecap, chance to win every hour!"" reward programs that seemed like a scam. With a nation/worldwide contest how could you possibly be the winner, or even make sure that the 'winner' was a real person.

Two kids from my grade won working by together for months. They asked for caps from other students for most of the offer period, then one day near the end, super early in the morning, they entered the maximum number of codes per person, each, and probably on multiple accounts. And they kept going for a few hours. And somehow, they both managed to be the winners. One sold theirs, bought a retail copy, and pocketed the scalper fee for games; the other probably still has it since it has it sitting in their garage as a trophy."
"I got a free iPod this way. I think it was freeipods.com or something. No one at my school could believe it, until they saw the iPod and the T-shirt i got. 

It was one of the first sites. I did it a couple of other times with different sites, and so did my sister. We got about 1k worth of free products."
"There was one just for housewives that traded grocery store coupons. We were poor, living in the country (there *is* country in California) when I was a single mother. 

I clipped a *ton* of coupons and had them all organized in folders. I used stores' weekly sales items too and my coupons to save money. Then I made my shopping list. 

I am a very detailed person and don't mind the minutiae of things, so I worked hard at it. My shining moment was when I bought two carts full of food worth around $350 dollars, for around $35. For real, I'm not even kidding. In 1985 that was a whole lot more groceries than it is today. Meat heavy!

So those really do exist, but it's a 10-20 hr a week job, and you have to be good at it, if you really want to do it. I did the shopping once a month, and drove my pickup to 3-4 stores to redeem them all. 

Plus downside for today's shoppers, a lot of coupons are now in store only.

Then we moved to the Bay Area, and I went to work for a Fortune 100 investment and retirement planning company, and didn't have to do it any more. Memories. 

There's a lot of simplicity to living poor. It teaches you a lot of things you'll use later in life. Before the lean years were over, I had a vegetable garden that was around 1800 sq ft. I froze all we needed for the winter, and learned how to can tomatoes and a few other things. 


I even won a blue ribbon at the county fair for best salsa. I still have the recipe somewhere,  if anyone wants it, a super good simple one. Lol.

Oh, an FYI: You can get season passes free to any county fair if you have a small minimum number of entries in any exhibits. Have the kids do cute flower arrangements or their own veggies, so they get some passes too. Better parking, free too."
"Totally assume most of the ""win a ______"" are a scam.  Interesting to hear that wasn't true.

The $1 trials were good except if you got a bad one that wanted to maintain customer retention.  stamps.com  was one of those back in the early 00's, we got a free trial but it was literally hours on the phone.  100% not worth the free scale.


Also, your post is lacking in math!"

"Huh, did you mention that somewhere?"

"And now there's an actual X stupid website. Thanks, Elon!"
"I built 2 gaming pcs, paid off my couch, bought a ton of tech all from those websites."
"My wife and I went through some financial hardship and she found some similar sounding website that would basically show you ads and then ask you questions on how you felt about it. 

IT was obviously incredibly low paying even for me who works in IT so can read and click through stuff very fast, but it at least gave us cigarette money (for her, I don't smoke)"
"Yep, I made a ton of money and got a bunch of free iPods back in the day.  It was a lot of work, though, and I would never recommend doing it to anyone because you really REALLY had to know what you were doing and be quite careful (and track everything) to turn a profit."

Not sure when the real ones existed but I fully completed one and got nothing 
"I think I got something like 47 dollars from one of these when I was in college. The money was real but it sure was a waste of time. Don’t think I had to download anything. Just remember getting up to 15 cents a day using their search engine, which I would just do repeatedly without looking at results."
"Ditto. I got a few bucks using an ""alternative"" search engine (made it my default and every time I searched something, I could always re-search with google if I got crap results) and filling out a few surveys.

I wouldn't call them 'scams' (because they do pay out) so much as ""not worth the time"""
"Yeah, if no money was given, it couldn’t go far. This is the usual scheme: give money for more money"
"Plenty actually pay out. Some are scams. Had to file a 1099 a couple of years ago because I made thousands off of one of them.

Source: currently clean drug addict"
"Do you remember which ones actually paid out, specifically the one you made the most from? Please and thank you!"
"The way the legit apps work is you earn credits on the app that you can then turn in for gift cards to amazon, target, etc. The two apps I've used are YouGov and Swagbucks. 

YouGov is a survey site that will give you credits for taking surveys. They only offer a couple of surveys for you to take a week, so it isn't a reliable source of extra change. I've been using it a year and have made enough credits for $125. 

IIRC Swagbucks offers more ways to earn credits and there is always an opportunity to do so. They do surveys and daily ""tasks"". Their main draw though is that they offer ""challenges"" for reaching certain checkpoints in mobile games in a certain amount of days. But these are the shittiest, most annoying, ad-ridden mobile games ever. The whole schtick is that it is nearly impossible to reach the checkpoint in time without paying to win or paying to remove ads, so they hope you end up paying for things and then giving up out of boredom before they have to pay out rewards to you. I did this for a few weeks and earned $50, but man I hated those weeks lol. Many better ways to waste my time.

Edit: I wanted to add that I actually enjoy using YouGov and that I view the Swagbucks games as scam-adjacent."
FWIW YouGov is a legit site but it took me a year to cash out $100 so it's the literal slowest way to earn. It used to be a good way to make some holiday money for me for a while though. Start towards the end of the year and by next Christmas you can have $100 to spend on basically a few little things.
"Swagbucks also has a quasi-Fetch-like system where if you buy certain groceries from certain brands or subscriptions you get points. 

Some of the email subscriptions were dumb and you could use a fake email generator to farm the points."
"When I was unemployed, Swagbucks got me through a few rough months. I had most luck with the various casino ones.  I feel like some of them didn't run off real world odds where the customer always loses because it builds up to quadrillions of credits in some of them, but you basically just have to get jackpots, but once you get a decent backroll you can do most of them pretty easily.  Some of the typical mobile games were decent too, as long as you read the fine print.  Evony, whatever survival, puzzle blah blah, mostly the same shit, and usually the trick is to just join a clan.  People have also done write ups on how to optimize some of them, but usually it's like buying a $20 pack to get $70 reward, but you have to be careful to not mess up the requirements and get denied by support.   Then there's the various time trial games where you basically have to play as a full time job for a week to earn $30, using almost every last energy point to make it, maybe with 10% to spare.  The time-play games aren't generally too bad if you can get ones that pay more than a penny per minute, and not just downloading a game that feeds ads to you every minute for pennies an hour."
"Not the original commenter, and not thousands, but I've successfully cashed out about $250 in Walmart and Amazon giftcards through Mistplay. 

I don't think the Paypal option works based on reviews, but I've had great luck with the gift cards. I get about $50/month without trying too hard. When I was unemployed I was getting more. If you enjoy taptap games it's a fine way to waste time."
r/beermoney still exists. It's more work now for less money. I quit officially doing things in 2023 though. My best year was over $10K in money and gift cards. You have to report anything over $600 in cash now and I ain't about that life. I never reported the income.
"Having to report anything over $600 to the IRS has been true for decades, at least."
"Actually you're supposed to report any amount you make even if it's 10 cents. It's just that the services like Paypal had a ceiling that was massive and the covid bill put in a rider that Paypal, Venmo et all now report you to the IRS if you earn more than $600. It was supposed to go into effect last year, hurting small business owners and other people who use electronic payments, and the ceiling was lowered to $600 if you use Goods and Services. People gonna find out the hard way this year when it goes into effect but they could lower that to ANY amount as you're supposed to report every single cent you ""earn"" so the IRS gets their pound of flesh off you."
Crowdtap and Prolific pay out. Prolific is an actual research site where you get paid by researchers to do the studies. Crowdtap is surveys. I can earn $5-10 gift cards a week.
"Every one of them I've actually used, paid out.

The problem was, like OP said, you're working for well, well, below min. wage, and the payout is rarely in the form of actual cash.

I got a lot of magazine subs back in the day for filling out surveys.  And a decent amount of Amazon gift cards as well.  

I was going to be wasting my time on the internet anyways, might as well waste some of it making a lil bit of money.

And honestly, if there was a site like that that paid even $5/hr now, in actual cash (or maybe even wmart gift cards) I'd probably waste a lot of time on it too."
Pogo and Reward Play on this one you complete 2 of 3 task every other day and you'll score a $5 gift card. If you do the task you don't have to mess around with the games except for downloading a new one every other day but then you don't really have to use it since they're used counter isn't working right now and hasn't worked for over a month. But I still get the task done and still get my $5 gift card. I rack up quite a few
Your local beer money subreddit will have the best info.
"Swagbucks, freecash, and drumo for the games and sketchy apps. 

Surveyjunkie and PrimeOpinion for surveys. 

I've tried a lot of them, these are definitely the best ones I've found."
"I haven't used it in a few years, but Quick Thoughts used to be good. It was a flat $1 per survey no matter the length, and some were really quick ""watch an ad and tell us what you think of it"". It paid in Amazon gift cards, which I then used to buy Google Play gift cards to fund my Love Nikki addiction lol. I probably made ~$15/ week just checking it casually."
I used to crush it on quick thoughts. I averaged $10/day for a year or two only doing surveys on public transit to work. Paid for an entire Airbnb vacation from it. Then they made it almost impossible to make anything off of it and I haven’t used it in 2 years.
The sites dont work in Bangalore....
"Yeah I made a couple thousand off Swagbucks just playing games and doing a few sign up offers. 

However, I had a work from home job that required me to be on, but not actively doing a ton for a lot of the time, so it was nice for that type of situation. I wouldn't have done it with actual free time."
"I like that you said currently clean instead of recovering.

This makes me feel better about being a drug attic.   Recovering implies something is lost or missing instead of just a little dirty."
"It's mostly because I've relapsed a bunch. And I hate the idea that I've lost any of the things I've gotten from clean time in the past. 

I like the way you think of it also, though. Good luck brother."
"I got hit up by some guy selling this shit about a year ago.

I downloaded the software and got started with his instruction. Basically you would get offered some money and accept it then press a button 10 times or something and the money would be credited to your account. I kept going trying to work out where the scam was going to come from when one of the offers was a 'bonus' that pays twice as much but you have to pay in first to unlock it. 'Ahhhh' I thought, there it is.. The guy put the money in my account as he said it was the first one and he would pay it this time, i completed the tasks and got the money in the account.

I still don't really understand it completely but I'm assuming that it's going to ask you to drop like $200 to unlock a reward and then fuck you. I never went that far. I cashed out after his 'tutorial' and got about 70 usdt for about half an hour pressing buttons."
"I remember when I was a kid and a lot of browser games offered exactly this in exchange for the game's premium currency...in hindsight, what an awful thing to do in games targeted towards children. Of course the largest offers were the ones that made you install random fucking applications on your parent's computer."
"They aren't really scams, but you just don't make enough money for it to be really worth it.  I've made probably like $20 from a couple sites I found on r/beermoney"
"You could go mow someone's lawn or watch someone's kid and make more than that in less time... that's what makes them a scam. 

Its not that none of them pay out - some of them definitely do. It's the time required to receive any benefits."
"I wouldn’t consider GPT sites as a scam but obviously they’re not worth doing unless you live in a third world country but most surveys and offer won’t apply to you. 

I currently do something similar and it only earns $1 to 2 USD per day in Bitcoin for about 5 minutes of “work”. I won’t say what it is though because I’m not looking for competition. It’s not much money but It’s a pretty sweet deal considering for some services/subscriptions I don’t feel comfortable using a credit card and how do I get crypto that’s not linked to being purchased using my information either without going to a Bitcoin ATM and depositing cash? Real-Debrid is one of them."
My retired father makes tens of dollars a month doing hundreds of online surveys. Gives him something to do I guess.
Kinda the same for pay-to-play games. They will get people for $300 by having them buy shit $9.99 at a time.
"I've actually bought my outdoor furniture (2 Adirondack chairs, an end table, and a fire globe) and the wood stain I used on them through one of those sites. The return rate is nowhere near what I'd make with an actual part time job, but then I couldn't do one of those in my underwear when I have an extra 15 minutes of free time before going to bed."
The fact that soooooo many of those sites and apps do sponsorships with youtubers that may have a lot of children in their fan base is disgusting to me.
"Same with survey sites. You get 50% through only to be kicked out for ""not combatable""."
"And they ban you before cash out or add some barrier claiming you didn't fulfill it.

Oh, and that glasses one ""buy glasses in app to earn more"", no way, not that stupid."
Sounds like 12DailyPro. If you know what that is you're a real og
Those actually used to work and I made like thousands in the early days.
"I personally use one of those. Is it a scam? Definitely. Does it actually pay? Absolutely. I never get much from it, but honestly idc. I'm disabled and my gf works, so I'm at home most of the time and I get bored. Being low income means I can't afford many luxuries, and I enjoy those little toys Mini Brands. So I have my game money on my PayPal and that's what I use for my goofy little toys.

So sure, it's a scam, but it's worth doing for some."
"I fell for that crap when I was in college. I did all these surveys, transcriptions, and odd jobs and in the end, I was given a $25 gift card for over a month of work. I gave up quickly after that.

I never downloaded anything nor used special search engines, but that sure sounds like a privacy concern!"
"Hey man some were legit back in the day. Some.

That’s how I got like $20 in credit to buy new characters for Facebook games in like 2013 lmao. Can’t believe some surveys actually worked and I got in game currency.

FWIW it was also on a burner FB account with a burner email and no personal info tied to that account."
I definitely fell for one on the basis that it was an app advertising money for surveys and there were no real popup ads in app. Worked great for the first cashout but I eventually noticed a lot more surveys became suddenly cancelled for 'too many participants'. I later realised I was spending way too much time doing multiple minute surveys for cents of a dollar.
Google opinions?
"My mother in law has been taking pictures of all her paper receipts for TWO YEARS and inputting them into some app. She told me proudly she's half of the way there to a $25 Amazon gift card. 

How the fuck is this worth the time?! Not to mention, do you really want to give some random app a record of everything you buy?

But she wants that gift card, so..."
Facebook is currently inundating me with ads telling me that I can make money by reviewing products. The comment sections on these posts are flooded with folks asking for more information. The few of us who realize it's a scam of some sort can't get through the noise.
"I used to do one of those when I was 12 or 13.  I was probably making something like 10-15 cents an hour, but at the time I thought it was the only way I could make money that I could spend on the internet.

Then one day, at the bank, the teller said something along the lines of ""oh, your checking account doesn't have an ATM card yet, let me fix that"".  And I was confused and asked why it looked like a credit card.  When she told me that it was also a debit card, and I could use it anywhere credit cards were accepted, my mind was completely blown.  I could now actually spend my allowance on what I wanted."
"Truth. But way, way back in the day you could get Bitcoin for watching YT videos to inflate the view counts and make them ""go viral"". Sort of like when publishers buy their own books to make them hit the NYT bestseller list. One company was called virool. 

Of course back then BTC was worth like <$1 so this gig paid pennies per hour. I hope some random people did it anyway and got rich though."
"You know what's crazy about this? Around 10 years ago now I signed up for something like this, except you were supposed to be sharing expertise. I just ended up filling in surveys for $1 worth of crypto at a time. Surveys dried up after earning $30 worth of crypto (Bitcoin), and I was yeah right, I'm never getting this money out of here. Low and behold, I was able to transfer the balance to a legitimate wallet, which shortly after the election is worth $800. I've never touched it, and just check in on the balance one a year or something.

But obviously, everything since has become a scam. I've never seen anything like this again."
Those are successful because they have dozens of ones that actually do give you what you want after 1 or 2 steps . I used to fall for these scams all the time and it’s entirely because they stack smaller prizes that you can actually achieve in a few steps which are fully valid .  This convinces you to go after a bigger prize which takes all the work only to not be there
"Does anyone else remember a company called AllAdvantage? They had a toolbar you would run with your internet browser that would display rotating ads at the bottom/top of your window while you were connected to the internet (on dialup in 1999/2000). Considering how little time I spent online, it was a bit of a goldmine for a 15 year old kid. I got a few $25 checks from them.

They apparently only lasted for 2 years. Wow."
"Some online games in the 00's used to do this in exchange for the paid currency. Finishing surveys, watching ads, downloading apps, etc. They paid a pittance for essentially your personal data but 10 year old me was just happy to receive 3 Dragon Coins or 20 NX lmfao."
"I've gotten a few hundred dollars doing these, but the time sink became too unmanageable. Too often, you'd complete most of a survey only to discover that you hadn't qualified for the reward. I'm sure the survey company kept the answers anyway, basically getting my information for free. I had to stop doing it."
"I remember being 13 and falling for something that was obviously a scam.

it was a ""steam account money adder"" where you typed in your steam username, watched an ad and apparently your steam account would get money.

I watched several ads before realizing, ""wait a minute this is a scam""

it was basically an ad-watcher installed on my desktop.

luckily it was harmless and didnt give my PC a virus nor did it compromise my steam account, as it didn't ask for my password. if it HAD asked for my password, I would've KNOWN it was a scam."
When I was like 10 I got GTA San Andreas for free doing that. I actually couldn’t believe it worked. Let me tell you I remember staying up for hours just to get that thing.
So you’re saying you don’t like making .02c/hr that has to be spent at a store where everything is overpriced?
While they make millions off of selling your info
Microsoft is pretty bad abt this kind of stuff too. Just spent $50 to earn 4% closer to $1.25 gift card
"In college I did a few weeks working at [ChaCha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha_(search_engine)) they paid from a pool of money, and distributed it based on the percentage of time/answers you gave. They owe me at least $2 for my time served lol"
"An old buddy scammed the fuck out of one of those companies - Swagg Bucks or Bux or somethin. 

He made some bots or whatever and made it seem like dozens of people were using the site as intended but they were all his bots while he slept n shit and he made several thousand dollars off the site before someone working there patched the vulnerability he was abusing and everything stopped working. 

He tried a few times to get it goin again but it never lasted long after that first couple months and the accounts started getting banned too quickly to cashout and such and eventually he gave up on it."
"I've actually gotten a decent payout from one of these. I do have a couple of rules that I follow though: I never spend my own money on any of the apps/games, never allow permissions beyond those required to run the apps (so no third-party tracking if I can avoid it), and if I'm linking the games to Facebook for bonus points, I'm linking them to my secondary FB account which I only ever use for games (it's under a pseudonym and doesn't have any ""likes"" or ""friends"" so there's no data there to steal)."
"Take this survey get $5! To complete this survey, take this survey! To complete that survey, take this survey! To complete this survey, purchase this book!"
"Lol yea really, they do this with stupid mobile games now too"
I remember making a shit load of robux off of one of those as a kid😂 Somehow I made it think I did the task multiple times and I got $20+ worth of stuff that I have to this day.
"Bro freecash is actually goated and I think I’ve made like 3k off them in the past 2 years just playing stupid iPhone games and taking random surveys. Sure some of it is scummy and most games are ass and just ad modules, but some is actual interesting shit and it gets pretty catered to your interests. 

If anyone is interested just DM me and I can get you a link and check my profile I am not a scammer lol"
"Now what’s popping up on tiktok and Instagram are slideshows set up like “things I learned while working at Crumbl” or “what I learned while living in Japan” then the last slide would be “they don’t want you to know that you could do these surveys for $500 SHEIN gift card”. I try to report them and put a comment there to warn gullible people but my report either gets dismissed or my comment deleted. If it sounds too good to be true, then it is. No one is that generous for a questionnaire. I feel bad too because a lot of those slideshows steal photos from random people’s personal accounts so when they do get in trouble for the scam the angry mob would attack a random rather than the true perpetrator.  I had a bank manager tell me too that those links would sprinkle in some personal questions like “what’s your average income?” “your zip code?” “Age?” so they can sell it and worse case you get identity theft and someone trying to access your accounts. Avoid those links at all costs!"
They're absolutely shady. Some of them are not necessarily harmful but all of them are absolutely not worth it. People think they're saving money by wasting hours of their lives for pennies. They'd literally get more by working.

what’s the point if you’re not gonna name names
"Amway, Herbalife and any pseudo-pharma-sounding crap."
"> Herbalife

I know a couple that built a whole store for Herbalife shakes... put  a ton of cash into it etc.. It lasted as long as you'd expect."
We have several of those stores in our area. Truly not sure how they've survived as long as they have.
Criminals use them for money laundering.
I got tricked into an Herbalife sales pitch disguised as a party friend of a friend was throwing. This was like 15 years ago and I'm still bitter about paying to go to a fucking sales pitch.
"Same. I had a *pharmacy* classmate invite me to his house for a ''arabian food themed party"" to celebrate him finishing his studies. It was amway bullcrap. Wtf. We were housemates before."
Isn't the new HHS going to be pushing that?
"He’s probably going to announce that Herbalife is the new affordable care act replacement, America is signing up and just needs three other countries to sign up under us and they can get rich by signing up more friendly countries too"
I really wish there wasn’t a grain of truth to this joke
"One of our relatives came to visit us and said that my mom needs to use 'their product"" because she's fat ( while they are more obese than my mom).... that triggered my brother and he told them to get the fuck out of the house. They immediately left because my brother was about to go physical."
"I knew a couple who put a lot of money and energy into to Herbalife promotion and sales. They even claimed to a relative of mine dying from cancer that this will cure him. 
The husband ended up killing himself after a few years into it due to debt and financial troubles."
"Pit bulls are the new Amway/Beanie Babie. People get them, are told that they're valuable, will pay for themselves with a few litters. Thing gets knocked up, they think they'll be able to get pre-orders on puppies to pay the incoming vet bills. There's no pre-orders. Situation becomes a ticking parvo bomb, most of them end up in shelters."
"Puppy mills in general are just greedy cruelty. My friend suggested we should start a puppy business, which was weird, as I had him as a friend of animals, but apparently he did not know my ethics, at all. WTF"
"My grandma is one of those who made a ton of money through Herbalife. She’s not smart, she was super attractive, and she’s stubborn AF. She was involved with HLF way before it arrived in France. She would fly to LA, buy a ton and move it back to France for her own consumption. When they opened in France, she was among the first ones and she made a killing. She bought an apartment cash in less than 3 years. She did it for a few years, then she met her 3rd husband who set her up financially for good. She’s been taking the product for 30+ years, she’s 82 yo and she is in great health."
Jeunesse
I’m pretty sure Herbalife has a big lawsuit going on
"Herbalife hides in a lot of “nutrition” shops. We had a bunch of juice/smoothie places pop up in my area and knew immediately that’s what they were. Duh around on their websites and sure enough, Herbalife."
"The gift card one!  I know a full grown adult who  got an email from their ""boss"" telling them to go buy gift cards and send pics of them back to  random email address. $5000 later..."
"Just had one of those the other day, they claimed to be the CEO of a startup I was at a few years back and then asked me for Xbox cards 💀

I sent them a photo of my balls"
Send another email asking if they have a size preference
"It was a text, I deleted it shortly after. I don't even work for that company anymore and the CEO they were claiming to be was ousted by the board a year before I left.

(The actual ousted CEO would have found that hilarious, too)"
That is gold
"I would attach a screenshot of the conversation if I could - y'all think I am lying. I am not. 

Ok, I am lying about it being my own balls. I couldn't be fucked to take a flattering photo and grabbed one off google of an elderly dude holding 'em out.

I even warned them that was what they were going to get but they just asked ""how soon can you get to the store"" 

Never did hear back after."
Nah bro I believe you. But from that last part it sounds like you were talking to a bot instead of an actual person
"Eh, probably some Indian bloke who does 20 of these at once sitting next to 15 other people doing the same in a fake call center..."
"Entirely possible, but they claimed to be someone I knew, and used my first name (also an indicator it wasn't the person who they were claiming to be, we had nicknames) 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Wait. They knew your name? That's concerning
"Not really. Encountered this kind of spearphishing before.

All they gotta do is pull details from LinkedIn and use some basic reasoning to figure out who might work with who. They likely got my resume or something from a data leak somewhere.

They used my name but didn't switch their keyboard, so the message had a bunch of diacritical marks that suggested an asian country. Not an expert there 🤷🏻‍♂️"
"I agree. Knowing someone's first and even last name to begin a scam with, that's just so last century at this point. It isn't impressive or intimidating at all."
"The part I'm gonna say loud: careful, they can get you for sexting if they want to get revenge on you for not falling for it!


The part I'm gonna say quiet: they deserved it 😈"
"At a call center i worked whenever i got a scam call pretending to be tech support ""testing"" to see if our rewards system was working, asking for points to be added to a ""test account"" i would put them on hold and cold transfer them to a random number i got off google."
It was a close shave but in the end things went smoothly.
Bro 🤣💀🤣
I'm taking notes 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"I also, need Xbox cards"
I gotchu bro check dms 😉
Wait me too
Username checks out
Hey man I need Apple gift cards. Can you do anything for me?
You lied. I’ve checked repeatedly. I’m now sad
"You can google ""hairy balls xxx""  and probably find the same photo I sent 🤷🏻‍♂️ 

My actual body isn't for sale"
I'm gonna start sending dick pics to scammers now.
"Sounds like a good way to end up in a sextortion scam though.

Don't send them dick pics if you're not ok with them being sent to your mum.

Also the scammers might just report you to the police for it. Scammers can be real shits."
My mom's been dead for 8 years so they're gonna have a hell of a time trying to get them to her. I also never said they had to be mine.
Cut a lil hole in the casket and slide copies in😔
"Oophfff, Dude."
That's why you find dick pics off the internet to send to the scammers. They don't know it's not your dick but if they send the picture to my mom it's clearly not me.
Good thinking. Your mom would know it’s not me either.
"> Don't send them dick pics if you're not ok with them being sent to your mum.

Doesn't have to be YOUR dick. Send em the one of that thick guy sitting on the edge of the bed lol."
send them someone else's dick pics obviously
">Sounds like a good way to end up in a sextortion scam though.

Don't send them pics of yourself. It's not like it's difficult to find dick pics online.

>Don't send them dick pics if you're not ok with them being sent to your mum.

How else do you let your mom know what a growing boy you are?

>Also the scammers might just report you to the police for it. Scammers can be real shits.

LOL, where do you live where the police would actually do anything even if a real person was being seriously harassed, let alone a scammer? But please, let the scammer come in for an interview with the police and sign an affidavit over this."
"I once send goatse image to a whatsapp scammer, wonder why it never replied."
"I have a whole folder with the goatse series (it's quite a lot of pictures) and as a closer Tubgirl, every scammer gets those dropped to them"
Then they'll start using them as the before in dick enlargement scams
"ummm... actually, I am the CEO of the startup you worked at. Can you send me *Xbox cards*? 👀 👉👈"
The brain!
Could you send me some Xbox cards?
Sweet ahh revenge right there
"Had it happen to a coworker once while were at an offsite. He got the text while we were all sitting in the room together, CEO included. The funniest part was the text was something like ""I lost my wallet. I'm traveling and need money to get home.""

As soon as the coworker got the text he turned to the CEO and said, ""Hey man, if you need help you could just ask. Why are you texting me in the middle of the meeting."" Then busted up laughing at the scammer sending the text at the worst possible time."
"Yeah, at a different startup our data science guy fell for it and sent some documents - funny part was the person the scammer was posing as was literally in the next room while that happened. Good times.

Work with the best and brightest, right?"
Very good 😂
"The IRS version of this one is lethal. You get contacted and told you are like $75 outstanding on your last income tax filing and have until the end of day to pay it off before charges are filed.

But the IRS only takes apple gift cards"
It's 11:33 p.m. And I just had my one and only laugh for today. Thank you!
Here's a startup idea to get free only fans content - to pretend to scam people
"Dunno where you have been, but Instagram is full of AI generated face swaps of popular models selling only fans content already.

React to any public posts and they'll start sending automated DMs, liking random posts/stories, anything to try to get you to click on their profile out of curiosity. There's a few variations of the campaigns, pretty sure it's fully automated so the conversion rates probably don't need to be high.

Dead Internet, etc"
I ignore all of these. Responding just lets them know they have a valid email address and ups the fee they can charge to sell it. Same with texts.
So I'm not the only one that got xbox credits on his balls?
no
Xballs.
"That's when you find out that, while it wasn't sent from the CEO, it was sent as part of a phishing test sent to the whole org. And the CEO has seen the responses!"
Like basketballs?
How did they get past Barry Zuckercorn!
"If there ever was a justified reason for a dick pic, there's the one!"
"Whenever I come across these I string them along. ""Okay I'm going to by the gift cards, the store is 20min away....oh yeah it's taking me longer to get there because the highway is closed, but of course you know that because you live in <my city>...okay I have the gift cards for <something not resellable>, oh you wanted Apple gift cards? my bad, I'll go get those now"" whenever I get bored I'll say I have the gift cards and then send pictures of goatse and pig poop balls and whatnot"
Lmao 😂 imagine what that person thought when they opened their email.
Fucking amazing
"Was that CEO's name Barry Zuckerkorn ?

/he's very good..."
"Next time:

....Blue...Waffle"
Send them a blue waffle
Excellent response.
Barry Zuckerkorn: *those are balls*
"Oh, how I bust out laughing! Love it!"
I can’t believe I’ve never done this holy shit
🤣🤣🤣
"> I sent them a photo of my balls


What an absolute GIGACHAD"
That’s actually how the scam works. They ask for gift cards (you’re obviously not falling for that). To “get back at them” you send them “unwanted” ball pics (they sell those online for millions of dollars). 
Best response to this shit I've heard of.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👀😫
"My parents almost fell for one. They were convinced the power to their business was going to be shut off and they were going to lose all their refrigerated product. They were so scared of losing all their patients medication that they would have done anything.

I told them “The power company DOES. NOT. CALL. AND DEMAND. VISA CARDS. If they want you to settle your account on a Saturday afternoon let’s drive to the office and give them cash. Please put down the gift cards.”

It’s not that I’m smarter than them. I just wasn’t strung along into a panic like they had been."
"My GF called me in tears because some scammer was threatening her that there was an arrest warrant out for her and she needed to provide info right now (pay a fine or something) and the warrant could be stopped. 

After a few minutes of getting details from her I told her to just hang up.

They fucking wrecked her.  If I could find that person... well... nuff said."
"This really infuriates me. People who don’t have any interaction with law enforcement don’t understand that the cops don’t call you up to make sure that you are ready for them before they come over to arrest you. And you don’t pay a fine to a cop or an officer of the court over the phone. 
A really evil variation of this scam is that the scammer will call the cops and request a wellness check for the person at the house, so that the cops do show up."
"this is how the police operate in a lot of countries though so im not surprised if this scam would be very successful against immigrants.

the one, literally ONE decent thing about American policing is that its not as systemically overrun with bribery like it is in a lot of other places. because they dont need to take bribes. They can just steal from the taxpayers with phony overtime :D"
"they almost got my grandma when she was in her late 90s , she tries to convince us to take her to the atm so she could meet the guy that was going to invest her money in lottery tickets. It was really sad, just knowing how serious she was, it had been going on for some time and my family was monitoring it closely, but that was the final straw where someone legitimately had a meeting spot and everything"
"Ooh, poor gran!"
"Yea 💔 it led to us having to take away her cell phone and hide her mail. It caused a lot of distress to her, but they were hitting her from all angles, and her mental state was very slowly starting to degrade at that time. I actually think she got some checks out, which is what alerted the family member who was helping that something was up. Then it became obvious how obsessed with checking her mail and missing phone callls bc she had won. It was really sad to bear witness to, not even bc she was a close loved one but just how vulnerable elderly populations can be. And how sneaky it was bc we have a decent amount of family who was with her daily and very much apart of her life everyday. Once we knew what was up, I saw it coming from every angle of communication. None of us were looking for it or expecting that people were aiming to scam her, so it was missed initially… but once clued in, we all felt pretty dumb for missing the signs."
"Well, you could buy her a little gift, like a shawl or something,  and wrap it.

""Oh, gran! Looks like you won something after all!"""
"that’s a sweet thought and very creative, definitely something to keep in mind for others going thru this 🩷 she passed away at 101. She lived a long happy life surrounded by lots of kids grandkids and great grandkids… she even fell in love and got married again at 80!

Her mentation took a turn very late 90s, I want to say 97 is when it got a lot worse, but she was pleasantly demented (for many this is not the case, it can be terrifying confusing and awful for all) - she always believed her first husband would be coming home shortly from work - he had been passed away for nearly 40 yrs at that point. I want to say the scams happened when she was 95ish. 

It’s been 4 years since her passing. I appreciate the kind thought ❤️"
I said above I wonder how these people sleep at night
"I used to get these. I drag it out enough (I love wasting any phone scammer's time) to get more solid info on their location or good leads. That way I can report it to actual detectives and shut it down. They may be con men but they're not frequently hearing people talk in a way that appears cooperative bit is really military investigation techniques and negotiation tactics. There's only a few people I'll rat out to the cops, pretending to be a cop to leverage people for money is one. That's lower than a snake's ballsack in my book."
That is so beyond fucked up. The level ppl stoop to
"“See mom, I told you, I’m not getting arrested, I’m just learning how not to be scammed!”"
Do you have a special set of skills??
Just a special girlfriend.
John wick had a special lady
That bitch.
One of them is definitely on the spectrum
Oh she is special alright
"Us nukber?

Good chance I got you. Especially if it wasn't a burn number messaging me."
Well that turned out a lot more wholesome than I expected.
She's amazing.  And a newly minted gun nut. ❤️
Sounds special
my man!
Hopefully she's smart around guns at least.
"She's an enthusiast.   Safe as safe can be.

Looks like folks here dont approve of girl and guns from all the downvotes.  

."
"This is Reddit, most people are already biased against guns here. People on the fence about guns are fine if they are bought and used as a tool and with respect, but by saying ""gun nut"" people get the implication that she's just another bumbling uneducated American buying too many guns she doesn't need. Not saying that's how I feel, but that's why."
Reddit is super left wing
I have a backhoe.
I have 3000 acres of abandoned coal mines
We should join forces!
That could actually be pretty intimidating if used the right way.
"No, just the universal key for large earth moving equipment...."
"skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that’ll be the end of it."
I do!
"Unfortunately, they’re usually in other countries and, well, dealing with them might cause an international incident. Of course, if that happened a few times, there might be a lot fewer people willing to work scammer jobs."
"It's frustrating, because the phone companies could end this shit overnight.  Prevent callerid spoofing unless you can prove you own the number, and make them liable for losses (hit the SIP vendors).

Know your customers...."
"This is what makes me so angry about all of these people being ripped off by scammers from spoofed numbers. If the phone providers gave a rat's ass about the situation, they could end it immediately, but oh wait, that might cost them money to implement..."
Well it actually gets worse because there is a huge vulnerability in SS7 that no one really talks about. It basically let's you take over someone's phone number and it is not really spoofing it is taking control of the phone number. Veritasium did a Youtube video about a month ago Exposing The Flaw in Our Phone System. The problem is no one wants to be first one to take the first step to move to the more secure system.
"I've gotten that call so many times I just laugh at it now. It's definitely preying on people to panic, causing  them to not think straight, like most of these scams."
"I like to waste their time as long as I'm not currently busy. I'll string them along as long as possible and then pull up stuff like crazy porn videos on another device to play the audio at them. 


If I end up with them yelling at me and calling me an asshole or telling me to go fuck myself, I won ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
"This happened to my little sister. She’s a nurse so an arrest would cost her literally her career. She panicked and payed the person almost $5k. Luckily she got it all back. But that’s not the point. I was quite shocked because my sister is incredibly intelligent. Not just book smart, I couldn’t believe she fell for it. When I asked her ultimately what had her convinced it was real, she told me when they called it came up as the local sheriffs department on her phone, at one point she hung up the phone, went to google and called them directly. When she did the scammers picked up."
">  went to google and called them directly. When she did the scammers picked up.

I find that hard to believe."
I thought it was wild too. I assume they cloned the number somehow and it was directed to them when she dialed that number.
Same thing with my wife. She was in hysterics for hours.
They tried this on me while I was at my office at the agency they were pretending to be calling from. I fully know better but the ONLY reason these scammers didn’t get me is I realized if I was truly in trouble I wouldn’t have been able to get into the building I was actually in at that moment. 
"I worked for Apple at the time I got a scammer call and tell me they were notified that my computer had a virus.  Mind you, I’ve done tech support for many years.  And I’m not an idiot.  So I played along.  

Oh no! Which computer?

Your pc.

Well that sucks because I have a Mac.

Oh, yes I meant your Mac.

Well that’s odd, I do tech support for Apple and..

*click*

Fun times."
"Once I realized the deal I definitely kept the guy on the phone for a while, figuring it was harm reduction (if he’s talking nonsense with me, he’s not extorting someone else).

I actually think the people that work in these scam call centers are some of the lowest people on earth. I get they’re mostly from places where its one of the rare ways to make a good wage that isn’t physically dangerous. But you have to be some kind of stone cold sociopath to extort thousands of dollars from strangers at random because it pays a few bucks a day. You don’t even get most of the proceeds like a normal criminal would!"
"> I actually think the people that work in these scam call centers are some of the lowest people on earth.

In multiple ways, by design. It's shame their countries actively refuse to do anything about them and the vast amount of corruption in their law enforcement makes anything except vigilante justice impossible. I wish more ethical hackers took it upon themselves to destroy those people (especially the ones actually organizing the operations). Like, I don't mean exposing the operation (to no effect), I mean ruining their lives ""Hackers"" style, bricking their devices, stealing their money, getting their accounts blocked, planting evidence for terrorism, etc."
Take my upvote!
Agreed
They think all Americans are rich so they don't care.
compared to your average Indian...
"That’s impossible, when they’re scamming everyone including having old people on fixed incomes on the hook trying to “cooperate” and unable and threatening them. Its a moral failing. "
"Absolutely,  I'm saying the people doing the calls from 3rd world countries think all Americans are rich, so they feel zero remorse. The ones who have a functioning conscience that is."
"I’m saying there’s no way the scammers actually believe that, although they may well use it as their excuse. "
Someone hacked my Snapchat and threatened they’d leaked all my nudes a couple years back and told me they wanted 200 in gift cards not to do it
"I frequently receive scam calls and my approach is to act like a good victim and play along but slowly. I make sure to burn their time. As much as possible.  

Keep fake visa numbers that pass initial checksums handy.

Been there. It was awful. I cried and later felt like an idiot.
"The high pressure and urgency and social engineering they use can be terrifying, especially if they catch you at the wrong moment.

"Years ago someone called my number saying there was a warrant for someone with the same last name as mine, but they kept mumbling the first name, so ""We know you're \*mumblemumble\* Lemons and there's a warrant for your arrest!"" Asked them to spell the first name and they went into a meltdown, pretending they knew my full name and address and would have me arrested. Lady was even doing that weird forced laugh that crazy people do. 

She kept calling me off and on for about a week but apparently from her own phone number. Caller ID had the same number every time, so I would know it was her, I'd just pick up and hang up (this was in the cordless phone age) before I heard a word. I also filed a police report. She kept calling until I finally told her I'd filed a police report and asked her if she wanted the report number.

These people are nuts."
Oh god I’ve had like 20 warrants a while back.  I just said I’ll come in and have “officer joanne smith” who happened to have a very thick Indian accent come arrest me.
"Yeah they operate on the fear and high pressure. 

I remember my dad got a call from ""Me"" that ""I"" was in a car ran over a person and the idea of the scam is that cops would come and were ready to let it slide for a bribe

They didn't know I was at home sleeping lol

So he started giving me instructions on how to dispose of the body. He was like ""Where are you? I can come help - No I'm far away in the woods or something like that - ok, then make sure he's dead and run, we'll ask Uncle Vano to hide you in Armenia until it settles, go now, I'll deal with the body"""
"this exact same thing happened to me… the kicker was the call actually came from a general courthouse #. I usually just hang up, but they caught me at an odd moment and it just felt super real. I was in tears saying there’s no way this could be the case, I’ve never been been served any papers… once they told me to meet at the courthouse with a check I came to my senses. 

I don’t know how I fell for that one, but on the phone I googled the # and it was for the la courthouse and I was wracking my brain thinking I missed a ticket and it turned into something crazy. Anyway, that one got me. Right moment of weakness when I happened to take the call, and the legitimate #…still not sure how they were able to use a real generic la courthouse #. I just don’t pick up any calls anymore, they are all scams"
">still not sure how they were able to use a real generic la courthouse #.

Spoofing."
"Oh I just googled this term, did t realize that was a thing ! Jfc the lengths people will go to swindle eachother. Damn shame"
"I’m not sure either, these #s usually pull up as spam. I found some other posts claiming the same

https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/s/E5zwJ9miJL

I don’t know how they were able to use the #, but it was definitely some kind of county court or something in la. 100 a scam tho"
"I LOVE those calls! I usually ask how many police will be coming to arrest me, so that I know how much ammunition to stockpile before they show up.  
It usually ends the call right there."
"We were spending the day viewing real estate listings with a friend who was starting her career as an agent. She was dealing with this as we were touring houses. When we finished, I told my wife there was no way we were going to use her as an agent if she (the agent) was that naive..."
"A coworker's friend got that kind of call and WENT to the gas station they told her to go to, got money out of the ATM and gave it to the ""shady men with guns and badges"".

Pay at a police or sheriff's station?  Nope.  A freaking *gas* station.  She's beyond lucky."
Sherif doesn’t want Xbox cards either.
"I got that phone call once, well voicemail and when I read the transcript on my phone after I had gotten out of the shower I about had a heart attack lol, luckily I was able to google and find out it was a scam."
Sorry to be the one to tell you but it's one of two things: she's either really stupid or she is actually doing something or had done something that was illegal.
"Your girlfriend must be really pretty, huh?"
"No offense... but you're dating a complete idiot. If she's not able to identify right away that this is a scam and move on imagine how clueless and gullible she is about other things. It will only get worse and cause both of you major problems in the future.

Like I can't even imagine not being able to identify this as a scam right away. People like this have to just struggle through every day."
"That's exactly what scammers bank on, the panic. People in a panic act instead of think things trough. Most would not fall for scams without it.

The next big motivator is usually greed like the giveaways or Arabian prince/businessman scams."
"And the other half of the puzzle: Once somebody has gotten past any initial doubts, it is extraordinarily rare that they go back and reflect or re-evaluate.  So a decision made in panic will stay made, unless you're talking it all through w/ somebody else."
"My mom got the ""hey this is the local sheriff department and we are on the way to arrest you for not paying taxes"". She woke me up in a panic, completely hysterical. Of course I was tired and barely cognitive. Once what she told me made sense I just asked her why would the cops tell you they are on their way to arrest you and give you a chance to flee. And then i proceeded to pass back out.

I guess what I said worked because when I woke up she was laughing about it."
"As frustrated as we were that my in-laws did NOT comprehend how email works, sometimes I'm glad they didn't."
"That sounds like a blessed existence. There are many profoundly vulnerable people in my family and it's almost a part-time job making sure they don't fall for scams. These are people who raised me to be suspicious of absolutely everything but as soon as the scam vector is not in-person it's like their ability to critically evaluate a situation just melts away.

Having to be a bulwark against this makes me feel awful as well because you can only field phonecalls at 11pm about ""bank"" texts so many times before the empathy well runs completely dry."
"My grandmother also keeps falling for the same kinds of scams and at this point I find it hard to empathize either. She’s constantly getting those IG accounts with names like “YOU HAVE WON AN IPHONE 13”. She always gives her CC info bc they need to “verify her identity” or “charge her for shipping” or something. She’s gone through 8 DEBIT CARDS!!! She always swears that “this time, it’s real!”"
"Getting them to keep themselves alive was a part time job, lol. I'm glad we didn't have Nigerian princes on top of it, too."
"Fear is a great nonsensical motivator. Dad lost $4,000 this way. I am so pissed that they sold him this at Sam's Club. No one buys multiple $500 gift cards anywhere. No one! Sure, they have signs, but the staff needs to be trained. He also bought Bitcoin, but i got that back when he finally told me what was happening... Wish I had left that account there, however...

OMG. These people suck."
"Ironically my work got me multiple gift cards as part of a ten year bonus, and they have had some fun proving they aren't scamming people."
"Yeah, that's wild."
"I’m certainly no genius but it does blow my mind what people fall for. To me all of those things are sooo obviously a scam. Maybe I’ve just seen them a lot more than the average person, idk"
"Like he said, it's all about inducing panic in the victim.

You and I, we're not in a panic right now. So we see right through it."
"The scary ones are the ones where they use trickery to make it look like they just accidentally gave you thousands of dollars and they're going to get fired and/or arrested unless you send them gift cards because they can convert those into money.

They basically convince you that it is a little scammy, but it will help them save their job.  And honestly as an IT/computer literate person, the way they do it is fricken genius.

I just wish stores would make it obvious that if you're buying thousands of dollars worth of gift cards at someone else's request, you're getting scammed."
"Stores do make it obvious. Many have signs about gift card scams, and have employees mention them at check out. Many stores also limit gift card purchases for this reason. 

When I was in college my boss at my shitty part time retail gig told everyone he was going to buy “a brand new Cadillac Escalade” off Amazon for only $12,000. He had to pay in Amazon gift cards, which are maxed at $500 each and most stores only sell 4 at a time to the same person. Not only did I and everyone in the store tell him it was FAKE, but he was eventually blacklisted from local stores for buying too many gift cards. He started traveling further and further for the gift cards, and he finally got the $12,000 total, 24 gift cards and he had to take pics of all of them and send them to the Escalade seller on Amazon. He was beaming, calling us dumb because his Escalade would be delivered to his home the next morning, that we were all jealous haters. He missed a few days of work after that and when he came back he told us if anyone mentioned the Escalade we’d get fired. 

Some people are beyond help."
">Stores do make it obvious. Many have signs about gift card scams, and have employees mention them at check out. Many stores also limit gift card purchases for this reason. 

None of the stores around me do this."

"My elderly step-dad nearly fell for one also
We had a big fight about  it and he asked me how do I know it's not real

The thing was sent via a FB friend. Send in $1000 and you get $10,000.00 back. I asked him.. In what world have you ever paid for something and they give you all that extra back? And your friend got hacked. That's bit actually  her telling you

Mum told him if you want to be a thicko, take it out of your bank not the joint one.
I suggested if he's that gullible then perhaps the internet is the place for him"
"Yeah, and there's the FB marketplace one where you're selling something that's like $100. Someone messages you and says they'll buy it for $1000 but you need to ship it. They send a check for $1000, then say they need $500 of it back since they mistakenly overpaid.

You send them the $500, the fake check then bounces and you're now out that money with no recourse."
I don't even answer the phone anymore unless I'm both expecting a call and recognize the number
"> It’s not that I’m smarter than them. I just wasn’t strung along into a panic like they had been.

A grown-ass adult who thinks that a utility company might call customers to demand Visa gift cards in lieu of payment is not a particularly intelligent person. Critical thinking skills did not come into play at any point in that scenario. If your first reaction to an implausible claim is to blindly believe it, and then react emotionally as if it were true, then I have a number of bridges for sale..."
"> a utility company might call customers to demand Visa gift cards in lieu of payment

They hang up on me before I can even pull the electric bill out of the paid folder usually because I ask which account."
"> I told them “The power company DOES. NOT. CALL. AND DEMAND. VISA CARDS. If they want you to settle your account on a Saturday afternoon let’s drive to the office and give them cash. Please put down the gift cards.”

I'm a police dispatcher and a common scam is the scammer will call someone pretending be a sergeant and tell them that they missed jury duty and unless they give them some specific gift card they'll be arrested. I always ask what gift cards they requested and it's like, why would law enforcement request itunes gift cards??"
"My cousin forgot to show up for jury duty for a month.  No phone call, he just showed up and told them he forgot.

We do have some judges that send the sheriff's office out to pick up the wayward jurist but they don't call first nor do they take gift cards as bribes."
"> It’s not that I’m smarter than them.


Umm they were trying to pay their power bill with gift cards on a Saturday. I beg to differ with your conclusion."
"The scammer will adjust to your reactions.

In your case, you might have expressed scepticism about the weekday, so long before the gift cards, they would've said something along the lines of

>I understand sir, let's talk again first thing monday. Please know that the power outages may begin as early as tuesday afternoon, and also this early action service call was willingly postponed by the customer.

And I'm no scammer or energy expert, so add in all the lingo/personal information you want to add credibility.

My point is they pivot as soon as they detect suspicion. And they can smell suspicion from a mile away, and they adjust accordingly.

Also, they don't need a 100% hit rate. 1% is enough."
"My parents fell for this, too. It was the IRS calling you with back taxes version. The IRS but they will only accept Apple Store gift cards.

Luckily a random clerk at the pharmacy they went to buy the cards knew better and stopped them."

My aunt fell for the MS scam about viruses and ended up getting a few grand stolen from her checking account because of it. I scolded her like a child. I told her that she can always text or call me to ask if this is legit or not; or to help her secure her PC.
"> I just wasn’t strung along into a panic like they had been.

This is why these scams work on some people. They get people into a panic to override their normal sensibilities and rational thought. ""I don't want to be arrested by the IRS! I don't want my power to my business shut off!"""

">It’s not that I’m smarter than them. I just wasn’t strung along into a panic like they had been.

"This happened where I work. Marketing gal spent her own money because the CEO emailed her in a panic to provide gifts for some high profile people. Turns out it wasn't the CEO and I don't think the company reimbursed her. She might have been able to dispute the charges on her credit card but I don't know.
As the IT guy, I now get all the spoof emails sent to my inbox and there's a lot of them. Fewer requests for gift cards nowadays, mostly it's claims that they changed their bank and need to redirect their direct deposit."
"Also in IT, on rare occasions I get these faxed to me so for fun I take them off the printer and highlight the typos share them with people in the office."
"As for to the pending matter, we hope that you will do the needful and provide the funds without as to delay."
"The typos are there on purpose, or so I've heard"
"Yes, to filter out the totally unsavvy from the rest"
"Yep, every bite at the bait requires a human touch to respond (at least before the advent of AI). Mass email is cheap, people are not. Minimizing the amount of the marginally competent that respond but catch on during the scam is smart. They only want the very, very gullible to respond."
You have people faxing you scam emails?
I guess they'd technically just be scam faxes. Somehow our fax number got out and we would get these every now and again. Mostly stopped when we changed providers.

"I worked as a software lead for an insurance company for a bit back in 2018-2019.

We had a data partner who was only able to accept paperwork via fax. I tried to reach someone about it but could only get to their product manager, who wouldn't let me speak to their devs, and they were very insistent that they didn't have the engineering resources to set up a drop box, CDN, or API. Something something data security, something something allocation of manpower, something something compliance.

SO - I did what I could, built up a system that would generate PDF files from our modernized data stack, and forward them digitally into some BS enterprise service that would fax the digital documents. It took around a month to fully build, test, and deploy but it at least saved a ton of time and resources.

Six months later I happened to be at THEIR offices and someone mentioned in passing that it was crazy that they had an API architect here (me) for this project, but that our company was still ""insistent"" on sending faxes for the other project. 

It turns out that on THEIR end, they had purchased some enterprise service to digitally accept and decode faxes into digital data, which they had automated import for, and that had taken THEM two months to build as well.

So on my end, I was taking the raw data they needed, generating documents programmatically with all the letterhead and boilerplate and shit, and then translating it into a third party service to securely send them, and then on the other end they were digitally reading in the fake faxes, stripping out all of the boilerplate and formatting, and translating it right back into the raw digital data.

All this because some middle management needed to justify their job and wouldn't let the software people just speak directly."
"Fax numbers are still big in law and medicine. Almost everywhere has e-fax services now to bridge the gap. Some places don't like e-signatures like DocuSign so that leaves fax and courier.

Basically it's still kicking because of older gens not trusting e-sign, but somehow trusting fax."

"The typos are a filter, a feature not a bug"
I heard a theory that scammers purposefully put in typos to identify those who aren’t paying attention to details or who may be more easily susceptible to scams.
There’s still spammers using faxes?!
"Our IT has our entire company do bi-annual (twice per year) phishing training to identify scam emails. 

Some of them are very convincing."
"As they should be.

Making sure people don't fall for very obvious scam's is nice but there are actual dangerous threat actors out there who do proper research and use very convincing methods like finding out the date when salaries are paid out so that they can send an alert the day before warning that there was an issue and it needs to be solved by end of day or you'll get this months salary next pay cycle. 

Or if they're really good they track a specific high level manager, figure out when they're on a plane by tracking them on social media and send a malicious attachment ""from them"" while they can't be reached, pointing this out in the mail: ""Hey it's John, I'm on Terry's phone, phone's dead and we're boarding but I forget to send you this spreadsheet. It's for Mike, check the numbers and if they look good forward them to him. Tell him I'll be in touch when we get to Tampa""

Enough information will bypass most people's suspicion centers. There's so much publicly available data out there it's trivial to sound like you actually work somewhere so people need to be trained to follow procedures to the letter, no exceptions."
"This company I worked for would send out fake scam emails a few times a year, and then keep track of who properly reported them, who clicked the link in them, or who did nothing.

On one occasion however, one of the fake emails they sent was regarding a bonus all the employees were getting….needless to say some people were upset. A few hours later the head of IT of the whole company then sent out a company-wide email apologizing, stating that sending a fake bonus email was probably in poor taste."
"I craft these scam Emails for fun sometimes. (for testing employees - not real scamming)

From then on everything from the company i forwarded straight to the phishing email"
"Yep, IT guy here.  We have our system randomly send out phishing emails on a daily basis.  The same folks fall for it every time.  For some reason people cannot keep themselves from clicking on every damn link and responding to every email they get - it's like a sickness."
"The really annoying ones are the ones I click because it’s literally sent from IT’s email address- then I have to do extra training because I “fell for it” and shouldn’t open links from unknown email addresses, except I opened it because it wasn’t unknown… 🤦🏻‍♀️"
"We had a local coffee shop get scammed, a caller from the “FBI” convinced the assistant manager that their cash was counterfeit and she needed to take it all and go buy gift cards. It was about $700 and she was fired, probably worth it to the store owner to find out that they had hired a fucking moron."
Read that twice because I thought I must have missed something the first time. 
"Ah yes. You are in possession of counterfeit currency. We're just going to have you put it back into circulation. No Biggie, go buy some gift cards 🤡 It always comes back to fucking gift cards 🤣"
Honestly sometimes i wonder why i try so hard at work when people can get 700 like this
"Most fun I've had is when I got a call from the 'FBI' telling me there was a warrant out for my arrest.

  
Just told them that they'd never take me alive and hung up"

I was 18 and was newly a manager, and was so terrified because they were threatening me with arrest.

Valid. I just remember a lot of talk about the possibility at the time.

"It is hard to believe someone could fall for the ""gift card for CEO"" emails. WTF? How could someone be so gullible?"

"Doesn't help in most cases. As long as the card holder authorizes the charges they won’t do anything, it’s not covered under their regular identity theft fraud protection."
I wasn't sure but thought it would be a free call to find out.
"Aw, damn. Sorry that happened. And sorry it seems like the card companies might not be much help. I wasn't sure."
Proof point and other companies do phishing email training with simulated phishing emails. Those simulated phishing emails trigger a lot of retraining. But that hopefully reduces actual scam success
"Yep. KnowBe4 is another one, and Fintech, I think. Our MSP contract includes the service and we're starting it soon. This incident happened years ago, so we're right on track. ;)"
"Oh yeah i saw one of those ""changed bank"" making it past the filters and i honestly didnt really understand how they hook you.

""Hey its me, person you dont know, i changed my bank account, bla bla bla"" ??? OK, if it was an honest mail i'd still delete it whats that noise i dont know you mr."
"We're a pretty small administrative staff, so we all know each other. We also know that HR doesn't do that sort of change, but payroll does, and payroll only makes that kind of change in person."
"At work, I've been getting a lot of fake voicemail transcriptions sent as emails. Super shady!"
"Oh, yeah. Those are getting pretty common here too. Our top is still the direct deposit scam, but we're getting more of these. Some ""This is IT and your password expired"" ones too."
"I’m the evil HR lady, and I got one of the direct deposit scam emails! Didn’t realize it was a scam until like a week later, and very fortunately for the company, I have a severe case of “not my job/self service means SERVE YOUR SELF” and just told the CEO to change it in our HRIS."
Ha! Love it.
"I also have seen a female Marketing Manager get caught up in this, but at a former role and we both since moved on.

No reimbursement either! (Why would they?)"
"Yeah, I'm not sure why they would. It was talked about when this happened and I don't know for certain if they did. Stood out in my memory that so many people asked if they would."
When i worked at Walgreens I stopped so many people from buying hundreds of dollars in gift cards from these scams

"That policy is stupid as fuck, since the store gets left with the bill in the event of a chargeback."
"Bank wont do chargebacks. Chargebacks are for if either they A: Didn't authorize the purchase, such as card being stolen. Or B: The merchant did not provide the good/service. I.e. fraudulent billing. They don't cover buyers remorse. 

If the card holder knowingly made the purchase and the merchant provided it, i.e. the gift card is functional, then the bank will dust their hands and say you shouldn't have bought it then."
"Unfortunately, as a retail store owner, customers absolutely file fraudulent chargebacks. Our margin on gift cards is basically nothing so we have to foot everything. 

That’s why I have my employees quiz people on why they’re getting the gift cards. (But make it sound like friendly conversation)"
"Truly, thank you. I work in finance with the elderly with dementia and the ones who are all alone have no one to stop them. It’s so so sad and awful. We froze this clients accounts to prevent her from taking all her money out to give it all away to scammers, which is what we caught on she was doing. She went behind our backs and took out a second$30k mortgage on her already paid off house.  She gave it all away to some creep online. We couldn’t stop her from doing that. I was devastated."
"Oh, that poor woman. You tried. Scammers are awful"
My boss went to jail and within 24 hours someone tried to scam my manager with one of these. Saying they could pay his bail with giftcards...lmao
I just love the thought of someone trying to get out of prison by trying to pay whoever it is a £100 of Amazon cards.
"Where those scammers are from, that's actually how it goes."
"I’ve seen a few stores with a sign near the cashier, warning about scammers and gift cards.  It’s so sad.  I’ve heard the stories of how some folks dig their heels in and insist that they know what they are doing, when the IRS is demanding iTunes gift cards to cover their taxes 🙄"
"When I had to work cashier for a small bit at a store, they trained us to be on the lookout for people buying a ton of gift cards and to ask questions for this reason."
"I've never had any people being scammed for gift cards, only scammers themselves. Common one was the damaged reloadable gift card. Card actually has a balance of $0 on it. Swipe, gives error because card is damaged and cant be read, manager can override to approve the purchase. Then it then tries to bill the card at end of closing day, the card is a balance of $0 and charge fails. But that's hours after the customer has walked away with hundreds of dollars in purchases, often gift cards (bought with the fake gift card).

I've trained every employee I've ever worked with about this scam and some of them STILL fall for it. Like, buying $200 in giftcards...with a visa gift card, should be all kinds of red flags straight out of the gate."
"> I've trained every employee I've ever worked with about this scam and some of them STILL fall for it. Like, buying $200 in giftcards...with a visa gift card, should be all kinds of red flags straight out of the gate.

Ironically I knew a guy who does this and got stopped at a Walgreens one day. He would go out and buy a few $100 apple gift cards, because he was playing a mobile p2w MMO game and would gift women whom he was ""dating"" in the game those gift cards."
My SIL got a call that she had to pay her taxes ASAP or she couldn't receive her disability check?  I can't remember the details but when she was at the store buying gift cards the cashier questioned her and explained how it was a scam. That cashier saved her money.
I wish you were there for me when this happened to me 😞
"Thank you for that. Guy at Mejier did that when my 80 yr old MIL got scammed. We really appreciated him stepping in, appreciate you!"
"Yep, the employee at my job who fell for it did, indeed, buy $2K worth of gift cards at Walgreens."
You were doing Gods work. Good on you.
"Thank you! My husband's aunt was scammed several months ago. The people at her bank told her she was being scammed and tried to stop her. She got angry with them and shut down her account, then opened a new account elsewhere and lost $9,000 as a result. The first bank told my husband they do not want her back."
So frustrating
"What's sad is the reason people keep falling for gift card scams is because they think they're being ""safer"" because they're not giving their direct banking info to people over the phone. That alone is enough to convince any old person that it's not a scam. It's sad as fuck."
"Good on you. A couple years ago my wallet was stolen and they racked up $4k in gift cards within 15 minutes using my credit cards. Luckily it was flagged as fraud so I didn’t pay a dime, but how were the employees not immediately suspicious?"
That was kind of you to do Snake.   Did Walgreens reward you for protecting innocent victims?   You’re an “everyday hero”.
"You are a good guy, I am glad you helped those people and had the foresight to just ask a simple question."
Thank you! They did not at Sam's Club. I hate that cashier so much.
Hero!
Good work!
You’re a good person !
"Thank you for doing that.  And I really mean thank you. A relative of mine fell for the"" the Sheriff is after you , pay the fine by gift cards or face immediate arrest"" scam. She thought her son was in trouble and spent 40K in cards. Money never to be seen again. That clerk just went ""oh well""."
"$40,000 in gift cards?!? JFC."
"JFC. Yes. And yes, I thought "" who could be so dumb to do that?"""
Real mvp
"Closest I got to falling for this one: scammer called my work and said he works for (distributor) and there were expired gift cards we need to pull from the shelves. I was extremely suspicious because I work night shift and it was 11pm and we don't usually have anyone come in or do Official Business on third shift. I told him we didn't do business over the phone, got the spiel of this is normal and how we operate, etc. I said okay.

He told me which gift cards to pull from the rack, then told me to grab the first one and get a sharpie, then told me to write some nonsense number code on the back. And then, the real shit: he told me ""alright, now scratch the silver bar and tell me the serial number underneath""

I'm not THAT dumb so I let him no "", I'm not doing that. We don't give out gift cards over the phone"". He argued, and I hung up finally. 

I'm not dumb, I just have severe anxiety and didn't want to do something wrong if this was real. I told myself if he asks for the actual code, I'll know it's 100% a scam. 

Fuck those people. They're predators, plain and simple."
"Shit like this can easily happen. I was going through my emails early one morning and I get an email allegedly from the Tax Office about a refund. Thing is, my accountant told me to expect a refund so I assumed that this was it. It wasn't until they asked for the pin to my bank account that I suddenly woke up and realised that it was a scam."
"Even if you gave him the numbers, it wouldn’t work unless scanned and activated at the register"
"Yeah that's what I figured. I don't do gift cards on my shift at all, so I've never actually activated one, but I know they need to be activated. I assume the next part of the scam would involve activating them in some way."
"Once they have the card number and pin, they can run an automated script to check the balance on a website every couple of hours, and notify them if the balance goes above $0.00

Once someone else actually purchases and activates the card (any random customer walking into the store looking for a legit gift card) the scammers will steal the money off of it."
"Well no, since the scratched gift cards won't be sold"
They have some kind of system that notifies them when the card is activated.
I Would have given him fake number after rubbing a penny across some random furniture to get the sound of scratching the bar off.  Let the scammer waste time trying to use fake code
It's serve them right.
"Wouldn't it have needed to be activated first anyway? You can't just steal gift cards from a store, right?"
"my assumption is that the next phase of the scam would involve activating them in some way, but we didnt get that far!"
The scammer was trying to be smart but not going in the natural order of activating a gift card. Actually activating it likely would've been the next step. Slightly out of order stuff can really trip some people up
"From what another poster said, they just write down the serials and pin and setup a script to check the balance of that card every hour or so. Prepaid cards usually have this on their website to check the balance, wouldn't be hard to automate it to go down a list. Once someone DOES activate the card legitimately, they now have the number and pin and can do purchases with it."
"So I always assumed gift cards had to be scanned at the register to be ""activated"" and then you use the code? 

Can you really just walk into Walgreens, scratch the code, take a picture with your phone and go use it online?"
"No, you assumed correctly. These cards have no value until activated/funded. 

They might have tried to convince u\/meat_uprising to add funds to the card after they got the code, just to mix things up a bit. 

Or they might have wanted u\/meat_uprising to return the card to the rack hoping that someone would buy it in the future (without realizing that the code was already visible)."
It 11 at night I'd have fun with it and read them random numbers. Let them get frustrated that the cards aren't working while insisting that is indeed what the card says. See how long you can string them along thinking they've got a bite and instead waste their time and energy.
"I always told myself that's what I'd do if I encountered a scammer. I watch Kitboga religiously! But in the moment, it is so stressful and scary in a way I didn't expect. It's easy to say what you'd do when you're not in the situation, but.. in the situation itself, everything is so much different. That's *why* scams work, IMO."
"Yes,  you are correct, they are.  I wouldn't even class them as humans.  They are evil, nasty, spawned from the devil and hell.
I have been a victim a few times over the last 10 years and love to see them exposed and executed.😄🤬"
"""I'm not THAT dumb so I let him no!!!!"" 


Are you sure about that?"
I'm on mobile and autocorrect does things. Why do you give a shit?
"Straight facts. Autocorrect is there to help people like you but there is no way in hell you started typing kn and it was changed to no.

Why do I give a shit? It's funny to point out hypocrisy."
"I didn't type kn. I meant to type 'told him ""no, I'm not doing that, \[etc\]'

I accidentally dragged 'no ' to before the quotation, because my phone lets me drag words around. Just thought saying it's autocorrect makes it more clear that it's a mistake, rather than go into intricate detail about some shit that doesn't matter. 

Hope that clears things up!"
Yet you went into more intricate detail. Keep going...

Wat u on abt m8?
"I had a coworker who fell for this and we are a nonprofit. Our CEO had to explain the 2K loss to one of our program funders, it was not a fun time."
Fell for it WITH the NFP's funds? Surely you mean ex-coworker?!
They did move on not long after this lol. They used their company issued credit card to purchase the gift cards. The scammer impersonated our CEO and said it was last minute for an event. We provide gift cards to community members for some of our programs so that probably primed them to fall for it - but it wasn't even a particularly good scam email. Lots of very loud yelling behind closed  office doors occurred.
"I know someone who ended up in (somewhat) the reverse situation. They worked for a tiny nonprofit, and *the CEO* got an email claiming to be from them and to change their direct deposit details. Which he promptly did, and sent like six weeks worth of their salary to some scammer. 

He, not surprisingly, did not get fired."
"And then the nonprofit paid the employee appropriately afterward, right? Because even if the company gets scammed, it’s still wage theft if you take it out on the employee."
"Oh, yes. That was not an issue; as soon as they brought it up, the CEO straightened it out and sent them their money correctly. It was just, you know, thousands had gone to someone else by that point. Thousands the nonprofit didn't really have to be throwing away."
"Yeah, WTH."
I want to see their resume.. lol Must be hot stuff.
"Reminds me of the time that my boss at a nonprofit asked me to check out a former employee’s résumé.

The employee claimed that he held nine college degrees (three each of bachelor’s, master’s and doctorates). Best job assignment ever.

I found out that only one of the degrees was legit - a master’s, surprisingly."
">claimed that he held six college degrees (three each of bachelor’s, master’s and doctorates). 


That's nine, friend. "
You’re right - my bad.
Now I'm just wondering how you get a Masters Degree without completing the Bachelors.
"They accepted his “diploma mill” degree from a place that was in Ohio if I recall. I asked a woman in admissions if she found it odd that he earned 30 credits (or something like that) in his last semester as an “undergrad”. I suppose we should have noticed that, she said."
"30 credits is definitely odd, but not impossible. The secretary in one of my university's departments liked to tell the story about a woman who essentially did 2x overload every quarter because of some life event, but that's still odd and the exception. Everyone in the department knew the story, whereas no one knew the guy you were talking about."
"I don’t recall if it was 30, 40, 50… some extreme number that he definitely didn’t do."
"Probably got an undergrad at a cheap online school nobody has ever heard of, and made up a few fake ones from schools that make people go ""Wow! They must be smart, they went to <insert Ivy league school>!"""
"I got one the other day.  The boss ( the real one ) and I strung him along for hours.

He was hilariously pissed off by the end."
"What did you do? I'd be a little wary of interacting with scammers in any way, shape, or form."
Check out how Kitboga on YouTube handles them. He does great work.
WHY DID YOU REDEEM IT!!!!
Jim Browning is also great
"For anyone who sees this and thinks it might be fun to do, and it can be (I used to have fun with some phone scammers), it's far better to just block and ignore. Pissing off someone at the other end of a criminal fraud network can invite retaliation - they know your email is functional now, and your IP address, just for starters. That can narrow your location and enable discovery of other personal details. Remember, it's not some geeky teenager goofing around, it's someone part of a larger organization for whom email fraud might be among the least violent things they're willing to do for money and fun."
"Yeah, I don't have the time in the world to string these kinds of people along. Any phone call I'm not expecting goes straight to voicemail, and the greeting is just dead air. Emails I'm not expecting? Trash bin, immediately."
I don't even have voicemail. If you know me and I don't answer you gotta text me or call back. I fucking hate voicemail.
That's why you use a burner account
"There's somebody impersonating my company and routinely getting our clients for $500-1500 in gift cards or Apple Pay. If you fall for this shit in the year of our lord 2024 then I don't really know how to help you man. 

And I'm not that kind of guy but...I know for a fact this dude is making more money per day through a couple phone calls than I am in a week doing honest work."

"You are an above average computer user. You understand people can fake things. You also have some level of common sense. Most people are one of these things, not all.

These scams often catch trusting people who think that you can't fake things on the internet."
My husband’s grandmother lost $12k this way. She got a call from “law enforcement” saying another of her grandkids was in lockup and she had to buy gift cards to get him out. I still can’t believe she fell for it.
Go watch the movie! Thelma.
I saw some folks buying like 50 gift cards in a gas station recently and the cashier tried to explain to them they were getting scammed and they were very rude to her and laughed at her and told her to mind her own business. I have been wondering how that turned out.
"From what I hear, they often get mad at the banks / shops for letting them do this."
"My team just stopped one of these, literally as the recipient was walking out the door to make the purchase. In this one minuscule case I have to thank AI based detections for alerting us to the email chain."
"Wait, I need more words. Your on site team were sending emails to discuss selling gcs to someone who may be purchasing gift cards for scammers, I think. And your detections to these types of conversations are built with (or supplemented with) AI?  Then your detection team discovered it and prevented in some way?

If so, rock on…if not, what do you mean?"
"I hadn't heard about AI-security before either, but found a really interesting blogpost on it:

https://ianchristopherryan.com/blog/2024-07-24-Generative-AI-Spam-Filter/

Current models achieve something like 98% success rate, but since you also need to consider false positives you can't really run it as a filter but more like a watchdog. Which, it sounds like OP did."
"AI security (or using AI for predicting, preventing and defending against online harms and crimes) is a real thing, that I know for sure. 

What I don’t get is how Shoesquirrel’s team detected it. What emails were monitored to find this potential exposure? Was this an insider event, or were on-site people emailing about the security footage of someone picking out a bunch of gift cards to buy, and their AI picked up on the internal emails, alerting the on-site folks to prevent the sale of the cards within the short time it took for the potential victim to make the purchase?  

I’m curious to know what happened, this isn’t clear what email chain was used in their detection."
I work for local government and one of our town planners fell for this and lost 3k. I really don’t understand how people fall for this!
"I went in to get my car fixed a few years ago, and one of the mechanics was having a full-blown meltdown in the office.

He had gotten a call from someone telling him that there was a warrant for his arrest, and he needed to pay $1000 in Visa gift cards or they'd send the police to his house.

""I got kids, I can't go to jail!""

Unfortunately, he'd already sent them $500, but we were trying to convince him to not send the other $500 because it was a scam.  His boss called the Visa card people trying to get that money back, and even she was saying something like, ""Oh yeah, definitely a scam, please don't send them any more money"", while seeing if she could do anything to stop the payment.

Even with almost 10 people in that office, as well as the Visa lady, all talking him down, he was saying that he was convinced, but I'm still not so sure that he couldn't be talked right back into it if they called later that evening.

I felt so bad for him."
"My GF got this one but called me while she was still on the phone with them.  She was a bawling blubbering mess but I manged to get the details and told her to just hang up.  Don't say another word, just hang up.

Surprise. She never got arrested."
"We have a close friend who fell for a similar scam like this, saying there was a warrant out for his arrest from an old DUI. He ended up paying the scammers close to $3k"
"I feel so bad for these people, not because of the scams, but because they must be absolutely no commonsense individuals."
"There's an old saying:


""Every day a dumbass gets out of the house"". 


That's why there are soooo many scammers. Because there are too many stupid people. Is it sad? Yes. But it's the truth. And they vote ... more than other people as we can clearly see. "
I see what you did there…🤣
"My mom literally fell for this like a month ago. I don't understand how.

She's not even that old, she's only like 50. She should know better than that."
Half of over 50 people I know walk around so dosed up on prescription drugs like anti depressants that they do some terribly stupid stuff.
My barber called me frantically one day and didn't know what to do. Sent like 3 or 4 900$ Nike gift card to federal agents to get a warrant cancelo lol. I felt so bad... He's a little older and doesn't know anything about computers or anything like that... Just lives under a rock. I felt so bad. Been telling him for years to get with the times.
"I was actually buying gift cards for work, we did sweepstakes for a company and our third party didn't provide by the deadline so I had to buy it in a pinch. The employees at the cash register were so nice and kept asking if this was for somebody over the phone or paying off a debt. I knew they were referencing the scams and I kept reassuring them that this was legit. 


It's nice they were on the lookout and more people should be."
"You guys are just jealous that I'm going to get a 5 million dollar inheritance, and it only cost me 100 dollars in Steam gift cards to validate!"
"I had one from a women in her 20s!

No. They're just stupid. VERY stupid. 
My dad almost fell for it. Instead of sending pics he brought them to his boss. It happened when that scam was so new it wasn't heard of yet.
"My great aunt fell for this, she’s unfortunately in the early stages of dementia and refuses to speak/listen to family trying to help. Got to the point that she lost her house"
Wait. They did it?!
My buddy's dad recently fell for the IRS block scam and sent $1400 in Walgreens gift cards. Unbelievable.
"Yeah I don’t get this one, it takes so much effort and steps and often other people involved, no one of them get triggered?

Or is it digital gift cards?

Also if urgency is such a massive red flag to me, I am more likely to double check things and take it slow or even leave it until tomorrow if it is marked as urgent.

If it is actually urgent they will chance me on teams etc or call"
"I got something like that at my prior job. It came from an email that was something like ""yourbossofficial49576"" (because that's how that works) saying they were in an ""official meeting"" and needed gift cards to cover some kind of expense for executives.

It's like.... there's no way anyone could possibly fall for that, right?

But I also worked in IT and one of the things I got in email (that went to multiple people in IT, I didn't specifically handle this) was when people failed phishing spam test emails. They were sent out randomly to random people (so word didn't get around that they were sending out a round of phishing emails) and the number of people who clicked on it was astoundingly high. We got at least a few a week.

So maybe someone _would_ fall for Your Boss Official.

*edit:* My job before that wasn't in IT, but they also sent out test phish emails, but everyone got them. Every few months, the department manager would message us that they were coming later that day and to delete the email without clicking on anything. It's like... dude, you're not supposed to warn us. That's not how this works. (Despite that, I was told someone people still clicked on them anyway. Also, a few weeks before I started that job, someone clicked on a ransomware email link that started spreading through the company and shut the entire company down for several _weeks_ as they tried to clean the systems and prevent further damage.)"
My husband almost fell for this one. I was kind of embarrassed for him for falling for it.
"My friend almost fell for this.  She was literally at the store to get the gift cards when she broke the rule and texted our boss to ask a question about them and our boss, of course, had no idea what she was talking about.  I had gotten the same email but immediately deleted it."
"My Dad almost fell for this. It was more the ""Hey you owe us money so go buy gift cards and send them to us"". I guess on the way to the store he realized ""Why would a company want a debt to be paid in gift cards?"" and hung up on the scammer. Scary times for susceptible people."
The grocery store I usually go to has a sign warning people about this right next to the gift cards now
"It still astounds me that people think, that CEOs or massive companies want to pay in gift cards. Lol"
"$10,000 gone in one day.  My sister got the call from the “tax man”.  She asked mom for the cash.  Brother drove mom to the bank.  Then to sisters place with the cash.   Sister goes to Dollar General and local grocery store in a tiny town, buying $10,000 worth of gift cards and then calls in their numbers.  (Or photographing and txting- she won’t admit how she sent them)

How many adults were involved and continued to let this happen!?    Still boggles my mind!    Anyone spending $10,000 cash in a DAY in our lil hometown is not involved legal enterprise.  Even spending $5000 at the local IGA should have been a HUGE Red Flag."
We had someone at work fall for that! She actually came into the office to deliver the gift cards to our boss and ask for reimbursement. Boss laughed right in her face.
But the scam doesn’t involve physically delivering them to your boss…
"No, she just figured she'd do that after getting the email. She didn't reply to the scammer. She just thought the boss had emailed her and she went out and bought like $5000of gift cards with her own money."
"My boss got hit with that on a Saturday at work, he called his regional manager, and HE even said to go do it! The cashier at the CVS stopped the guy they sent to buy them and said ""it's a scam."" These are people who make 6 figures and manage hundreds of employees, and yet they can't figure out what's a scam."
"Yep, IT guy here.  Had a VP spend thousands on iTunes gift cards from Best Buy, scratched off the numbers and sent them in an email.  After he spent about $2K of his own money he asked the CEO for a reimbursement and he said he never sent that email.  No amount of phishing training will help, posters, remedial training will ever help.  People put a higher trust in email than anything else in the world."
"I work on the IT Help Desk for my state government and we had 2 different calls in the course of a week from people who got emails from their ""manager"" asking for hundreds of dollars and gift cards, and they actually sent them.

They waited until AFTERWARDS to call us and be like ""Hey, I think this was a scam."" Like yeah buddy, we could have warned you of that if you'd have called us before sending these gift cards. That or, I don't know, **go up to your boss and fucking ask them if the email is from them or not instead of just blindly assuming it's normal for your boss to ask you for hundreds of dollars in gift cards completely out of nowhere.**"
"Yup, that last bit... How on earth doesn't anyone confirm such a weird request by simply asking is beyond me."
"This nearly happened to someone I know! The email looked like it was from the president of a club that he is the treasurer of. It seemed plausible at first, but the email address did not match the real president’s address. 

I’m still wondering how the scammer got the name of the club president person, and linked it to the person I know. I guess emails are not confidential!"
"You guess???


Please get off the internet. And don't use landlines either. For your own safety."
That was needlessly insulting.
"Yes, and now i know a lot of stores that sell gift cards are aware and even ask people what they are buying for/cap out at a certain amount, so then the people being scammed go to MULTIPLE STORES and don't think twice about it?"
"This happened to a colleague of mine just last week! An emergency meeting was called about it, as a good chunk of the staff got the same email from our ""boss"". The colleague was on the phone to her bank for ages, luckily was refunded. I was shocked she fell for it, thinking our actual boss would ask for something like that."
"Random bullshit story that I laugh about every once and a while when catfishing or similar things come up...  
 
My exwife would have probably fell for a giftcard/romance scam if I didn't try and be her friend after the marriage was done... she had agreed to a divorce and her ""affair partner"" had bailed... after she had paid a couple of his bills, and I was so over ""us"" I said, get on tinder and have fun like I am.    
 
We were weirdly of good terms so she showed me a match that she had and wanted me to try and look him up. She had two matches, this guy and someone who didn't reply to her. So apparently the one guy told her he was at some hotel(30min drive), and she went to meet up with him and he said something came up. I found nothing on the internet about him... yet he claimed to be a youtube creator. I laughed a little and jokingly said ""He's going to ask you for money.""  
 
So about a week later she came up to me and said ""You'll never believe what happened."" The guy asked her to go to the store and buy him a prepaid phone card so he could call her. The loops he went through, once she refused to go get him that card he wanted was hilarious."
"My own husband (ex husband now) fell for a gift card scam. He got a text from someone who was supposedly our phone carrier and said that if we paid that month's bill with gift cards, they would give us 75% off next months bill.
I wasn't home at the time by the time I did get home. He had just gotten back from the store from getting the gift cards and had called the number back and they didn't answer and that gave him his first clue. 🙄 Fuckin moron 🙄"
My mother in law’s “pastor” texted her saying he forgot to get a $500 iTunes gift card for a cancer patient. I wasn’t surprised she fell for it and she rushed out to buy one. But I was mad when she told me a woman she knew from Church helped her work out how to text the photo. The woman was early 40s! Who at that age doesn’t know that’s a scam?!
"I work at home depot. We're not allowed to stop or ask about gift cards anymore if they're under $2,000. Really. Have a lady come in daily buying $500 worth and we can't stop her"
"Knew someone a couple years ago who held a director level position at the company they were at. Bought about $2000 in apple gift cards on their company credit card to send to the “CEO”. Obviously this was fake. They realized it was a scam and just said nothing. No mention to a single person. Eventually an audit was done on charges and when they were questioned here is what they said. 

“I just figured I’d have to pay it back at some point. The CEO reaching out made me feel special so I went and got the cards.”

No real understanding or awareness of the issue. No realization that you can’t just run away from the issue. Asked why they didn’t mention anything so we could attempt a chargeback or report it and nothing.

Amazingly this person is still employed in the same position with a company card and it was essentially swept under the rug. They won’t make that specific mistake…actually I wouldn’t be surprised if they do. Not the sharpest tool in the shed."
"Crazy that someone would drop $5000 for their boss, much less after a random email request for gift cards. That at least warrants a phone call."
"Used the work credit card. And no, they didn't get fired."
And the shop didn't stop them? Where I am they all have signs saying they wont sell more then £100 or 3 cards to anyone and tells people that if some is asking for gift cars as payment it's a scam.
This happened at my workplace as well!
"I love those. Got one via text who told me he was calling on behalf of my brother, who needed bail money overseas. Since my brother was in the very next room this seemed unlikely. Scammer asked for $2000 but said the jail only accepts gift cards now!

I kept him informed of my ""journey"" as I went to my car, drove down to the nearest Walmart, and found the gift card aisle, Snapping photos all the way as he requested.

Finally he tells me to buy the gift cards, scratch the silver off the back, and send him a picture of it.
I kept pretending to not know what that meant  Took him 1 1/2 hours to finally give up . Meanwhile I just grocery shopped."
My wife fell for this. Luckily we called the VISA place and they actually refunded all our money. It was a miracle!
"I work in a small office and one of the newer workers got an email from someone pretending to be the director of my company asking for $200 in gift cards. The employee's desk was about 20 feet from the director's office. 

So, instead of going to the director and asking, or going to anyone in the office and asking, the employee bought the gift cards, sent the codes over by email, then went to my director to ask if he received them.

The director was nice enough to give the guy the $200 he lost, but the guy quit a couple weeks later."
"""hello I am the police, we have been watching you're internet and no you have done a crime, pay a fine of $5,000 in iTunes giftcards or we sent someone to arrest you for 6,000,000 years in jail.""

Adults for some reason: OH NO! don't send anyone I will pay the fine!"
"We got one of those from our ""boss"" when my boss was literally standing next to me. I then kept on asking him if I could go to Walmart instead of working."
It's becoming a classic scam and people still fall for it :/
I fell for this
"My wife went as a gift card scammer for Halloween, won all the costume contests our company held"
"They like to start these at my job by saying ""I'm calling from corporate.  Do you know who this is?"" which is a lovely attempt to get a name they can use next time.  I really wanna just start guessing bullshit names to feed them disinformation."
2 of our BUSINESS teachers fell for that one
"A friend mine, his mom got caught in the IRS scam to get gift cards and only realized it was a scam after buying gift cards to send them the numbers of. She got home, called them back and had some choice words for them. A few hours later while she was on the phone with my friend, the cops came banging at her door and slammed her on the ground saying someone called them to report she killed her husband. Husband wasn't even in the same state at the time, my friend was still on the phone during this whole interaction and freaking out because he lives in Europe. The cops didn't even apologize for slamming her on the ground, got all the scammer info and left."
Jfc one of my mom's friends asked about that while I was visiting once. At least she asked someone first. My mom (who is 84 and not at all gullible) patiently explained the scam to her. A lot of people are just too trusting and can't believe horrible people like these scammers exist.
"My mom fell victim to this scam 😭 $2,000 worth of google play gift cards. She has been trying to get rid of them for two years now."
"These are horrible and just about anyone can fall for one. The intent is to get you into fight or flight mode so your logical thinking goes out the window.

I am in a position where I meet with people of all ages and intelligence that have fallen for these scams.

It's not always gift cards and bitcoin they request. If you think you're immune to a scam like this, I assure you you're not. Be vigilant people."
"I have gotten hit with so many different flavors of scam and sussed them all out immediately - one time I even reported a legit company email as spam/scam lmao but I guess better safe than sorry 💀

For context: that email came from a third party that my company was using, not my company itself and it was not one I was familiar with (it was new), so that’s why I didn’t click the link and reported it lol"
Not anyone. You must be mentally challenged or stupid. 
"Agreed. We *all* get scam calls/emails/texts on a weekly basis. We intelligent people delete the message, or ignore the phone call, before they can even try to rope us into the scam. Smart people can see the scam from *a mile* away. Phone number I don't know? Scam. Duplicate Facebook account for someone I'm already friends with? Scam. Pretty lady randomly DMing me? Scam. Nigerian prince? Scam. ""Law Enforcement""? Scam. An 'American' person who can barely speak/type English? Scam.

If it's vague enough, we might reply to it, but then we'll immediately realize it's a scam. Only idiots are getting into long conversations with these scammers, and only the most stupid of the stupid are actually following their instructions and taking real world action to meet their demands."
I got one and *fell* for it for about 3 minutes. In my case it is not a ridiculous request. I’ve definitely had stranger. Went to email him back and voila.
The one I got was supposedly from the ceo from a spoofed email just asking if I was onsite today which wasn’t a rare request. So I just responded that I am today and what can I help them with? Then they immediately went to please buy $500 of gift cards which was small potatoes as usually they would be asking for a ton of patient information or business metrics that would be the usual request.
Happened to someone I know. Same amount too. Younger woman just out of college at her first big girl job. So unfortunate. I think the company ended up reimbursing her since it came from a legit company email or something to that effect.
"Happened where I work, too, the same way. I think they got $2K of gift cards from the employee who fell for it."
"One of the directors at my old company fell for this once, an email he got “from the CEO”. This is one of the top people in the entire company. I was shocked. I was an early 20’s secretary and I was like dude are you kidding me"
I had a retiree almost fall for this. She said she was on the phone with said scammer driving to CVS to buy the gift cards and the cashier refused to sell them to her telling her that it’s a common scam and if it’s really XYZ company then they should be able to hang up and them call back to their official number no problem right? Luckily the cashier convinced the retiree it was a scam. Turned out alright luckily for everyone
My mom has 8 grandkids in one branch of the family. We have to explain to the cashier *and* the manager of the local Target every year around the holidays why we're buying so many gift cards at once.
"I fell for that one, but I had random people in the real world ""encouraging"" me to keep doing it when I refused."
My local supermarket has signs up warning against this. Hopefully it saves some people
"I unfortunately replied to one from my boss. It was the ""I was trying to get ahold of you"" sent on my day off. And while it was unusual for the big boss to contact me directly it wasn't unheard of. So I replied ""oh I had the day off what did you need?"" And the next email was then ""I'm a meeting and need you to get gift cards for clients"". I felt so dumb"
"I know a 30/m restaurant GM who almost got caught up by someone claiming to be law enforcement and investigating their district manager. Knew the names of every higher up and that's what got him.. when he was halfway thru emptying the safe to go get the cards when he realized law enforcement wouldn't call you with a heads up, and they don't accept fucking GIFT CARDS!

I made fun if him for a long time."
Guy who worked for the same company as my wife got one asking for like 3500 in Victoria’s Secret gift cards and the guy actually did it 😭
I had someone try this a few months after I was laid off from a job.
I like that a lot of retail locations have signs now warning people plus the staff are more alert and will ask questions if someone is buying an unusual number of gift cards.  Probably saved a lot of people.
"my coworker literally just fell for the exact same thing - we are a remote company and based all around the US. she literally was running around her city ON FOOT to go to different stores because her car was in the shop.... the kicker is, she's known our boss for years and has his number saved in her phone, yet for some reason believed the sketchy random number texting her was also him?"
"I had this happen with air b and b, got locked out saying I lost my privileges for being a bad user. I'd never used air b and b it was my first time making an account. Saw a customer service number to discuss the problem, when I called, the man said hi... not hello thank you for calling air b and b customer service how can I help you. So 1 sketchy.

Then I told the guy the problem with air b and be and he says okay you need to get, 200$ gift cards and blah blah blah and I was like what. Gift cards? He's like, yeah, at least this many, and then you can fix the problem. I said back to him what he said to me and then hung up. Found the correct number and fixed the problem. I know it was a scam and knew right away and air b and be had no answer as to why they were able to put that number on the app."
Happened to my boyfriend!
"My mom did this


She thought the IRS wanted to be paid back in Apple cards"
Our email system blocks at least 10 of these a week.
"I know its awful thing to happen 😔 but sadly people are still being caught out and scammed.  I for one, over a well known chain store gift card. 😞😡🤬😥"
"I was going into work a few months ago at a payment center, and a woman was demanding to be allowed in, because she wanted to speak with someone about the gift cards she bought to pay her bill. 

Was about 20 minutes late going in, but I talked her down, convinced her she was speaking with a scammer, and walked her through setting up an account through our app and making a payment. 

Thank God she didn't send pictures of the card to anyone, and was too confused by the process the scammers wanted her to go through so she just came to the office."
"Every damn ""National Administrative Professionals Day"" (Wednesday of the last full week in April), my entire team gets spammed by multiple accounts masquerading as me wanting to buy my admin asst. gift cards.  
  
I wouldn't mind, given the fact that I don't HAVE an admin assistant.  But the scams worked THREE TIMES (twice on the same person).  The victim's excuse?  ""I didn't realize our team didn't have an admin assistant.""  
  
HR Representative:  So that's why you sent out a company-wide email calling anyone who fell for the scam an idiot?  
Me: Technically, I called *everyone* in the company idiots.  And I stand behind that statement."
Trump
"Seriously. I work 911 and the amount of people that call in saying a ""deputy"" called them and told them to pay fines for missing jury duty or go to jail. Then tell them to buy Apple gift cards. They'll string them along for thousands to multiple stores, and then only some of them think that something might be up.

1. Did you receive any letter about jury duty? No?

2. Why would the sheriff's office/courts deal in Apple gift cards? Or any gift cards? Do you think you pay speeding tickets that way? 

3. The police won't usually tell you they're coming to arrest you. They'll just go do it.

Despite these,  people get ran for thousands of dollars with these."
Why would anyone even consider doing so for their boss
I know an IT CEO who built up the company and was farming Bitcoin who fell for it. It was just so crazy.
"My company has had at least 10 calls from the CEO, owner, owner's gardener, fire department, etc...

They have the cashiers cunt all the money at the location, take pictures of the safes, put the money in FedEx boxes, etc.

Some followed way too many orders but no money was lost.  I had to develop training but even then, a couple too
K the calls."
This one is so prevalent that my company had to have everyone do training on how to NOT fall for this.
"My partner had not long started at her current job when she got an email from the ""CEO"" asking her to get £250 worth of gift cards. So she went to the shop and spent £250 on gift cards. The lady at the checkout said they were non refundable. 

After she bought them she emailed the CEO and said she had them. The CEO asked her to send a picture.

For some reason, she decided to phone me and ask me if it was okay to send it. 

I said no. I also said, please don't tell me you've just spent £250 on gift cards. Thank the gods that she did call me. Otherwise it would have been lost.

We then gifted them out over Christmas/Birthdays."
Wholesome ending.
"My mom fell for that one. Call from ""Microsoft"", telling her to buy *Apple* gift cards. Luckily, she only bought one and then called me. When we talked about it afterwards, she said she was so overwhelmed by their threats of bricking her computer that she went on autopilot and didn't even realize that this was two very different companies."
"Had one Saturday from the CEO.

But also a few years ago, when these first started I had not heard of this type.  Day two of a brand new job, I got an email from the owner to my 1 day old email address.

I lost 300 that day… embarrassing as hell."
"I was the treasurer of a non-profit for several years. My contact info was available online. At least once a week, I'd get an email saying that [President] needed me wire $25,000 to [random person/email] immediately.

Yeah, given that our gross receipts for the year were around $80K, it is highly unlikely that the president would be spending that amount of money before

a) getting it approved by the board

b) speaking to me *personally* on my personal/not publicly accessible cell phone number

But, guess these scammers have to shoot their shot. They must have success sometimes."
A cousin and my sister-in-laws parents both fell for this mess.  Just some random person called them & they both sent thousands. 
"I developed an entire B2B phishing training for a small IT company I used to work for. We had about 100 small businesses that we managed at that time. 

Shocked me how many people fell for the boss gift card one. Everyone who fell for it did zero authorization checks, did not double check with their actual bosses, just immediately complied with my request. 

As they say, the biggest weakness in a computer system is the human in the chair. Trust is the ultimate factor is manipulating a weakness"
"My friend got an even weirder one. One of his managers got a scam call and was convinced he had to take the money from the deposit box, convert it to Bitcoin, and send it to someone's wallet. 

You'd think he was part of the scam. But not, just that stupid. It confused the company, they were convinced he was in on it. Nope. Just that stupid."
It's getting even worse now with the power of AI to manipulate the voices. Now they can call and pretend to the the boss and no longer email or SMS texts.
"Funny thing about this one, Sony support actually did request gift cards to unlock my sisters account, which was really strange. It locked because I reversed a charge that was being used for PlayStation Plus and forgot it was going to auto charge for next year. I kept responding to their automated email, asking them if I could pay other with some sort of actual payment method, but they just kept responding with the automated email, no matter how many times I’d request an alternative method or request to at least receive a message that was written by a person. Finally, we caved in and just decided “alright, if it works, great. If not, well we’re just out so and so dollars and we’ll just give up the account.” We got the cards, paid the balance, and the account was unlocked! I think we had paid a little over because we also had a little leftover amount on the account to use in the psn store. Not sure why they go the gift card method, seems shady and terrible, but one of the extremely few occasions sending gift cards in an email worked"
"Yeah, I've had a CFO falling for this 2 years ago...Never looked at her the same after that."
"My grandma got a phone call from a “friend” asking for £500 in apple gift cards to “buy her son a present”. This is not someone she’s that close with, but even still she was ready to go and do it.

Once my grandad found out he had a good job convincing her it was a scam, she’s incredibly stubborn and doesn’t change her mind easily. So despite being presented with overwhelming evidence she wouldn’t back down. They had to phone the friend to confirm of course she didn’t want any giftcards"
That one where you get a random “wrong number” text from a gorgeous woman who wants to get to know you. I promise no actual women want to get to know a random stranger they accidentally texted.
"I'm a woman and I just got one the other day...but it said ""want to go fishing with us?"" and I got excited because based on who I am that seemed legit. Unfortunately when I asked who was texting me I got the standard ""this is Madeline, didn't you save my number?"" and was immediately filled with rage"
Soo…wanna go fishing?
Sorry Madeline I'm busy 😂
My assistant gave me this number. I hope I did not disturb your beautiful day. Do you use Telegram or WhatsApp?
They always wanna use another app
"Because most of the world uses WhatsApp for messaging, so they can do all their scamming from their laptop with the WhatsApp web interface"
"Yeah a couple tried to get me to install wechat. I was like ""fuck off loser"""
"I thought WeChat is mostly free from scammers, considering very complex rules of registration. Isn’t it?"
"It’s only hard to sign up if you’re outside of China. If you’re in China it’s easy, afaik you only need a Chinese phone number. And yes they have scammers too"
Never go to a second application.
How does Telegram and WhatsApp fit into it?
"I've heard plenty of theories over on r/scambait, where it's asked a lot. They include:

1. The phone they're using has limited text plan, and both apps are free.  
2. Both apps are end-to-end encrypted and nearly impossible to trace, so scammers are safely hidden.   
3. Phones are used by the honey-trappers, then the victim is passed to bosses who use the apps.  
4.  The apps are easier to use when multiple scams are being run at once--each conversation gets its own open window.

It's probably some combination of the above, but they always seem to insist on switching to an app. And by ""insist"" I mean once they bring it up, they keep bringing it up over and over and over, ad nauseam."
Also WhatsApp and telegram have a profile picture. It's free and easy to send photos to make the scammer seem real
"They almost always send a picture by text first anyway. The scammer sends a stolen pic of a young, artractive Asian midel: ""This is me [ri-i-ght]. May I see a picture of you?"""
"I came here for this question. I was stringing one along once pretending to be Kevin from the office and they kept trying to get me to use WhatsApp or telegram. I kept telling them I didn't know Morse code. Anyway, why couldn't they just keep talking to me on text message?"
"Switching apps makes it so the initial point of contact and then the followup are disconnected, so that any anti-scam measures and reporting can't be enforced. If you report the initial contact, on platform 1, it looks innocent and not unsolicited spam. Just a wrong number and small talk or whatever, but no mention of some investment or scam pitch or anything. So if you report it, there's nothing actionable.

But on platform 2, even though the scam gets mentioned explicitly, it looks like you already knew each other, due to the nature of how you initially connect. Switching platforms keeps their accounts from appearing to look like they are behaving suspiciously. You added them, after all."
Ah gotcha. That makes sense. Thanks!
this dude fucks
"Encrypted messages, which makes it harder to prosecute. "
Yeah didn’t he just say he has her number. Why does he need social media?
"Because those are either free or a lot cheaper to create new profiles in, phone numbers… well… I dunno…"
"Yeah, busy fishing and you don't want to share the best spots with me. I see how it is."
"Damn, I just wanna go fishing"
what a ball buster.
When?
Whenever? 🤷🏽‍♂️
"Forget RangerRudbekia, I’ll go fishing with you!"
"I’m game, are you within an hour of Austin or is one of us traveling"
"Ontario, Canada, got my passport ready 😎"
You may have better fish though…we’ll have to coordinate (it’s raining today). Maybe a costal charter?
"True, fresh waters all around! Coastal charter sounds great"
"Mostly flounder, sea trout and redfish on charters. Bass, catfish, perch, bluegill inland. But I do have a lake house in Wisconsin…"
Lake house in Wisconsin? You’ve got me beat. Best I can do is a small fishing boat 😂
"It’s family owned, great escape for Texas summers"
Is this when I ask you to join my crypto scam? I’m confused…I just want to go fishing…
"Oh no, I was under the assumption that I’d be the one to lure you into a ponzi scheme first, but we can go the crypto route too"
"Well, shit, I guess we should stick to fishing"
"Shoot, you’re right. We aren’t cut out for those other things"
"Tbh, they sound a lot like work"
Wouldn’t even know where to start 😮‍💨
I suppose stage 1 would be “research” but that sounds boring
"Stage 2: Marketing

Know anyone with that skill?"
Stage 3: profit?
💰We did it bois 😎
To the moon!!!
*my dear?
"Gross, no"
Catfishing?
Only the kind that uses chicken liver
"Sorry, they've already gone Phishing"
"Well, they were going fishing, just catfishing, which isn't quite the same thing."
"Phishing, if you will."
Or phishing
"I got a random ""hi mom, this is my new number"" text. I replied that I was shocked to discover I had total amnesia and didn't remember giving birth"
Username checks out?
"I wish I got one of those…

”Uncle TJ is now very, very angry! STOP TEXTING AND COME HUG ME YOU MISERABLE SON OF AN ANGEL!”

If I had a nephew… or a niece… or kids of my own…"
Honestly I appreciate the pun of running a Phishing attempt by asking if you want to go fishing
"Ugh! I've recently been getting ""Hey girl! How are you and the kids? Are you ready for Christmas? I just earned a lot of extra Christmas money with this new company! You HAVE to hear about it!"" 🤢🤢"
Wow a woman who is excited about fishing? You’re quite the catch!
"I got one from a very attractive (pic sent) Asian girl who looked who had a nice city-living jacket and accessories on like a beret. I looked up the area code.

North Dakota. THERE'S NO ONE IN NORTH DAKOTA."
Shit this is one I might fall for 😂
How do those scams work anyways? Is it just to build repoire?
"They text/call you to establish it’s a used number. 

Then they hope to snag you into using WhatsApp or Telegram or a similar app. 

If they can get you to jump into their scam…perfect. 

If not…they will sell your number to other people and those people will harass you too in hopes someone will reel you in. 

It’s best just to block and report junk and delete….than to answer"
"From what I've heard they build rapport and try and get you to invest in shady crypto schemes, which the scammers then pump and dump. People tend to fall for this scam because the ""woman"" is usually not openly flirtatious and won't ask you to send her money directly via sketchy methods. She'll just talk about investments with you and nudge you in the direction of investing in the tokens that the scammers want you to."
"That is the first step. The second step is asking for a small amount of money. Bus faire to get to work, or some food.  Always increasing the amount and the circumstance. 

Eventually you will be sending thousands to help with ""rent"" or medical bills.

Scammer gets big money over a long term but the payout starts slow."
"I got one the other day from a local number saying ""I thought you were going to be in the office today?"" and it made me panic briefly because I have ADHD and this is extremely plausible. But I also realized that whoever would be texting me that would already be in my phone."
Be the change you want in the world.. start sending genuine fishing requests.
I’m doing my part
Morning! Nice day for fishing aint it?
Shit I got that same one!  I’m still fucking with them though.
Hey cousin wanna go fishing?
"That is possibly the worst scam text I’ve ever heard of. If I thought someone was trying to get together to fish and catch up about life only to find out it’s one of those… my day might be ruined. Sorry that happened, you deserve to go fishing regardless (which I’m sure you did)."
Ha! Got the exact same one about fishing just the other day! Hilarious
"""Wanna go phishing?"""
"I told one that I was named ""Quandale Dingle"" and 'she' was upset that I was taking awhile to answer so I told her the dog was having a seizure"
"I usually reply with ""this is RANDOM NAME from HR, if you want to speak with HR, call the office on Monday."""
I got a similar one the other day. I just told them I couldn’t because I had to take the baby back to the hospital.
"The nature of my job requires me to take unique phone numbers I don't have recognized. They FINALLY got me with a ""Hey [my actual name] how ya been?""

I've destroyed my phone recently (swimming...) and could understand why all my contacts didn't migrate over. As soon as they replied, it was clearly a scam. aww :("
"Do a quick lookup of the number to find the location (usually area code will suffice) and agree to go along but pretend you're somewhere such as Tokyo. ""Lake Mead? Where is that?"""
"I got one recently and they were actually just super nice to talk to so I played along. They sent me nice motivational messages in the morning pics of tasty looking food at night, and random shit about their family.

Then after a couple weeks they asked if I wanted to invest in stuff and got mad when I said no, told me I was a shitty friend, and wished me a nice life."
"I mean, I'll go fishing with you. Sounds like fun! Do I know anything about it? Nope, but i am a good mom who bought my kids rods and bait their hooks and taught them to cast so a hook doesn't end up in my face"
"My kid loves it, highly recommend"
Oh yeah. It's an easy and fun activity. I found some bobbers that hide the hook inside of them that dramatically reduced my stress levels for casting
"Ok, but do you wanna go fishing today? I can dig my pole out. "
I have spares
If some rando hit me up to go fishing I would probably be down as well 🤣
Why wouldn't they choose a more common name than Madeline? Lol
"Many of those are pig butchering scams (Last Week Tonight did a great show about it).

I get random texts about wanting to go golfing."
I'm a dude and I'd feel the same way lol I'd totally be down for an adhoc fishing day with some randos!  I've met some cool people while throwing a line in at the local pier.
Yeah these would work better the other way around with lonely men looking for lonely women
"I got the ""are you still diving with us on Saturday?"" one. I played it a bit. Turns out ""Mia"" ""lives in"" Toronto.

If you're going to outdoor activities as a scam, at least make sure the activities make sense for the city you claim to be from."
"I got one of those, but my husband and I realized what it was and started messing with them and stringing them along. If you are going to scam people, I'm going to waste your time so you have less time to scam people."
wait I got the fishing text too!
I reply to these “Not today Satan” and that usually takes care of it and gives me a bit of a laugh.

If they don't, then whatever they had to say obviously wasn't important enough. Personally I block any number that calls me more than once and doesn't leave a message or send a text (they can still leave voicemails or texts, my phone just doesn't ring when they call).

A clearance isn't classified information.  You can request lists of classified people.  We put it openly on our resumes and linkedin profiles.
It's not a secret.  It's literally on my linkedin.
"The point isnt that its classified. The point is, and ironically at that, you're talking about complying with security measures (to a bit of an exaggerated degree...as if you have a Chinese waiter you dont have to go report it to security) while at the same time indicating to that same foreign person that you are a person of interest. 

Tl;Dr You're attempting to promote security at the letter of the law while simultaneously increasing your security risk."
"> The point isnt that its classified.

Again, this is public information.  It's not restricted.  It also doesn't make me anymore a person of interest because they wouldn't know what information I have access to.  A clearance doesn't mean you can just walk into the pentagon and browse the clearance level of the library.  Clearance means that I can be appointed to projects and receive information in those projects.  I could have a clearance and have no projects, I could know about what actually happened in area 51.  There is no way for them to know."
"Theres a reason you don't see people wearing ""I have a clearence"" buttons when visiting foreign countries. There is no way for them to know *what* you have access to but they do now know *that* you have access. You have separated yourself from the group of people who dont have one and thus increased your risk. 

If there was a public database or you could ask for a list of cleared persons (both of which a quick search couldn't find and Google AI says doesn't exist), you still exist in a sea of anonymity that protects you. Once you start connecting yourself to people individually, you start eroding that anonymity. Ultimately if Russia wanted to find people with clearances at random, they could probably do it on compiled information. But again, by being open about it, you are doing the compiling for them."
"> Theres a reason you don't see people wearing ""I have a clearence"" buttons when visiting foreign countries.

Because no one wears those buttons even in the states?  What a nonsense reply.

>There is no way for them to know what you have access to but they do now know that you have access. You have separated yourself from the group of people who dont have one and thus increased your risk.

Cool, that has nothing to do with what we're talking about now does it.

>If there was a public database or you could ask for a list of cleared persons

There is.  It's called a FOIA request.  As long as that isn't considered classified information, the government provides it.

>you still exist in a sea of anonymity that protects you

Firstly, anonymity doesn't protect you.  Secondly, having a clearance doesn't make you a target because a clearance doesn't mean you have access to something useful.  There are tens of thousands of people that have clearances but not projects attached to their clearance.

>Ultimately if Russia wanted to find people with clearances at random, they could probably do it on compiled information.

I mean, they do.  But that doesn't mean anything.  Because ""having a clearance"" doesn't mean anything except that you've had an intense background check from the government.  That's literally the only information you can gleam from someone announcing their clearance.

I could work on a nuclear submarine, I could be a NASA scientist, I could be a data analyst for the FBI, I could be a government contractor for the DoD, I could be a secretary of a lobbyist, I could have been employed by something that required a clearance, or I could be a retired army vet.  You have no idea.  That means you can't target someone for information.  Even if you know that they have a clearance in a place that you want information from, you have no idea if they're assigned to that project.

You've watched too many movies and think that a clearance simply means that you can walk into any place and access everything at your level.  It doesn't.  The only way you get classified information is to be assigned to it.  Period.  Simply having a clearance means you had a background check.  That's it.  Nothing else."
"Getting a little testy? 

> anonymity doesn't protect you

Lol yes it does?

> having a clearance doesn't make you a target

Russia has the option to spy on two groups of people. Everyone who has a clearance. And everyone who doesn't. Which do they choose? Cmon now.

> That means you can't target someone for information. 

But they are more likely to possess it.

> Even if you know that they have a clearance in a place that you want information from, you have no idea if they're assigned to that project.

But they are more likely to be.

Imagine being in a room with 1000 people. Each person holds a concealed marble. Someone is looking for the person with the black marble. They will use any means necessary to find out who, even nefarious ones. There are 998 white ones. You have a blue one. 

What you're saying is tantamount to saying aloud ""I dont have a white one"" and thinking you are somehow just as safe as if you kept your mouth shut. 

You arent. You can try and spin it any way you want to.  You can reply to me til you're blue in the face. But you openly telling the Chinese and internet strangers that you have a clearance is stupid. Maybe the reality is only 498 people have white marbles, and 5 black. But you are still increasing your risk, for literally no gain. Which again, is stupid.

By all means continue. I have no skin in the game. I'm just letting you know. 

> You've watched too many movies and think that a clearance simply means that you can walk into any place

I'm not sure why you think I've said this. I never have. I know what they are and how they work. 

All I've said is it picks you out of the pool of anonymity as a higher potential target. Even if you dont know anything...if China comes poking around into your life...it probably won't be pleasant. And hell...hopefully they actually believe you when you say it...but that'll never happen...right?

Edit: BTW, the government routinely laughs in the face of FOIA. Even if its not classified."
"> Getting a little testy?

Nope.  Just annoyed that you seemingly have no idea what you're talking about.

>Lol yes it does?

What does it protect me from?

>Russia has the option to spy on two groups of people. Everyone who has a clearance. And everyone who doesn't. Which do they choose? Cmon now.

This really just emphasizes that you don't understand what a clearance is.  They spy on both.  Because there are people without clearances that have access to sensitive  things.  Clearance doesn't mean you just have a treasure trove of documents on your hands.

>Imagine being in a room with 1000 people. Each person holds a concealed marble. Someone is looking for the person with the black marble. They will use any means necessary to find out who, even nefarious ones. There are 998 white ones. You have a blue one.

It's cute, but it doesn't work as an analogy.

>I'm not sure why you think I've said this. I never have. I know what they are and how they work.

You continue to make statements like you are an authority on the matter, that's why.

>All I've said is it picks you out of the pool of anonymity as a higher potential target.

Except that it doesn't.  I've provided you tons of information, and you continue to insist that someone having a BACKGROUND CHECK is a potential target.

>BTW, the government routinely laughs in the face of FOIA. Even if its not classified.

Ah yes, so at least you acknowledge that you were wrong.  That's nice.

Here, a simple question for you.  Ignore everything else and answer this.  Let's assume I tell you I have a beyond top secret clearance.  What information does that give you about what I have?  Why would a foreign government want to spy on me knowing only that information?"
"> Ah yes, so at least you acknowledge that you were wrong

The cognitive dissonance is real. YOU said anyone can access a list of cleared people through a FOIA. I said the government would laugh in your face if you tried to get one with a FOIA. *Youre* in the wrong lol.

> Ignore everything else and answer this. Let's assume I tell you I have a beyond top secret clearance. What information does that give you about what I have? Why would a foreign government want to spy on me knowing only that information?

Spy 1: ""We have a limited amount of time and money to spy on people. At full capacity, we could spy on 10,000 people per year. Who should we look at?""

Spy 2: Well the higher the classification, the more damage to our adversaries if uncovered. So spy on 9,999 randos...and include that one guy on who openly says he has Beyond Top Secret. Even if he doesn't end up knowing anyone, he's more likely to than some rando.""

&nbsp;

If you still can't grasp this. Again feel free to keep telling random foreigners. Good luck."
"> The cognitive dissonance is real.

Well at least you acknowledge you have it.

>YOU said anyone can access a list of cleared people through a FOIA.

Correct.

>I said the government would laugh in your face if you tried to get one with a FOIA.

You did say that, but it's not correct.  Yes, they can deny a FOIA, but they have to have grounds to do so.

>Spy 1: ""We have a limited amount of time and money to spy on people. At full capacity, we could spy on 10,000 people per year. Who should we look at?""

>Spy 2: Well the higher the classification, the more damage to our adversaries if uncovered. So spy on 9,999 randos...and include that one guy on who openly says he has Beyond Top Secret. Even if he doesn't end up knowing anyone, he's more likely to than some rando.""

And thus proving you don't know what a clearance is.  Again, I can have that clearance and have no access to anything.  Because a clearance is a background check.  Period.  Full stop.  Just because I have one does not grant me the right to go access documents or look at secrets.  The Russians already know this, which is why they don't care if someone has a clearance.

>If you still can't grasp this.

I can't grasp it because it has nothing to do with reality."
"Ha ha yeah that sucks man like I work in orbit of the MIC and I mean due to a slip-up my boss had to spend all day answering questions about why he gave out a particular research paper which he shouldn't because he didn't check which paper he sent...I confirmed twice and he said he was fine to declassify it, it even says secret in it, but he said it would come pretty corporate secret, it's fine. Of course he ends up sending it to the fucking British. And within like two minutes I got an email in my inbox saying like, what have I done?


They let us handle chinese contact,No official clearances or tie backs."
Do all people with federal clearance have to report like this? What is you live in say NYC or LA and move around international circles- wouldn’t people in metropolitan cities have quite a few of those reports to make?
"Afaik, you have to report *all* ONGOING foreign contacts and relationships.

No, I'm not talking about scam texts. You're all a picky bunch. Picking apart a sentence adds nothing to conversation. The other comment wasn't asking about scam texts/calls."
Close and continuing contact. You would not need to report a scammer messaging you.
Unless it’s at work.
"I didn’t mean to take it literally that OP has to report a scam text; I get that was a hyperbole. I was just surprised by the rule in general as I imagine that anyone who has e.g gone to uni in a big metropolitan city and then keeps an active social life in similar circles would still have an absolute shitton of foreign contacts to report, which seems like a lot of work to both report but also process."
"I wasn't responding to you that you need to report a scam text but to others who decided to pick that part. 

It's continued contact.

Speaking from experience, overseas family/friends, foreign friends, etc. must be reported. There's a bit of a hint dropped that they can check your messages, so don't share anything that might be skirting the line of what you can't share. Usually, you are not allowed devices made in China, either."
No you don’t. Close and continuing. Like a roommate. But not a visitor and certainly not a wrong number.
"> But not a visitor and certainly not a wrong number.

This is incorrect.  Any personal foreign interaction has to be reported.  If you don't you risk losing your clearance if they investigate you.  It's literally why some of the espionage cases have been found is that someone didn't report a singular interaction with a foreign national.  Especially from countries that are hostile, like China, North Korea, Russia, and Iran."
"No. Of course not.  If you have CLOSE AND CONTINUING contact. Like a Roomate or boyfriend/girlfriend.  A friend invited his business associate who was a government official from UAE to my house!  I was pissed, reported it, and the security officer said “we don’t care”. Hahah. They explained the rules to me then.  I can go to embassy parties and not report any of it."
"> Do all people with federal clearance have to report like this?

Yes.  Contact with any foreign national must be reported.

>What is you live in say NYC or LA and move around international circles- wouldn’t people in metropolitan cities have quite a few of those reports to make?

Those people tend not to seek government clearances."
No this is incorrect.
"Hilarious, but my reporting officer says you're incorrect."
"FFS, just google it!  

the reporting of foreign contacts is governed by section F(2) and requires, in part, that a person report any “continuing association with known foreign nationals that involves bonds of affection, personal obligation, or intimate contact; or any contact with a foreign national that involves the exchange of personal information.”"
"> FFS, just google it!

Again, I'm not going to lose my clearance on your word.  

>the reporting of foreign contacts is governed by section F(2) and requires, in part, that a person report any “continuing association with known foreign nationals that involves bonds of affection, personal obligation, or intimate contact; or any contact with a foreign national that involves the exchange of personal information.”

And my officer found that it was worthy of reporting.  Great, you don't report it and lose your clearance.  Good on you!"
Whatever. Have fun living in your box. My life doesn’t work that way.
"Good luck then, hope you can find someone new to baby rage at."
"I work in Washington DC. I have contact with foreigners all the time that are both related to and completely unrelated to any govt projects. I promise you, there is no need to report every contact.  That would not be possible. I don’t know what a reporting officer is, but my SECURITY Officer has explained the rules to me."
"OK, yours says that, I'm not going to get in trouble from mine.  Cool story bro!"
Ok but I’m sorry you can’t order Chinese food anymore.  Probably can’t have Pho or even tacos ever again because the reporting requirements would be too onerous. Can’t get your nails done or your swimming pool cleaned or you landscaping done. Good luck getting all your work done by American citizens.
"> Ok but I’m sorry you can’t order Chinese food anymore. Probably can’t have Pho or even tacos ever again because the reporting requirements would be too onerous.

Man, I love how you took something that was a direct and personal conversation, and changed it to be casual contact.  Cool man.  I love how you ignored what I said to make an argument of what you wanted me to have said."
"Dude, you literally said people who live in NYC or SF probably don’t have you LITERALLY wrote that “those people” who tend to live in metropolitan areas “tend not to seek clearances”

Friend, you’re just silly now. It’s obvious you do not now and have never held a clearance. Maybe you held a temporary secret or had a basic background check done, but you haven’t even been to the most basic of security training, let alone a briefing. Why are you even bothering to have this conversation?  Do you think it makes you look bigger to the people who don’t know what clearances are?"
"> Dude, you literally said people who live in NYC or SF probably don’t have you LITERALLY wrote that “those people” who tend to live in metropolitan areas “tend not to seek clearances”

You're going to have to rephrase that because it makes very little sense.  But, even under the most optimistic of readings, you don't seem to know what I said at all.  The type of people is what I was talking about, not the location that people live.  Hence those types of people and not those locations.

>Friend, you’re just silly now.

Nah, that's entirely your domain.

>It’s obvious you do not now and have never held a clearance.

Wholly untrue but ok.

I wasn't great at Chinese either, so it probably sounded absolutely filthy.

Just turned 28 November 3rd…"

“homunculi” 😂😂😂😂
They are crypto scams out of East Asia. That’s why
"I think they do that because they believe the potential marks are less likely to understand the culture and notice they might be fake.  

But some (Tinder) scammers do try to learn and research local things."
Right? Im immune to weeb bait but I would be in a world of hurt if it was a freckled redhead with translucent skin
"I get these texts monthly. They always start the same.

Scammer “Hi Alfredo, are we still on for golf this Saturday”

Me “Wrong number”

Scammer “I apologize for inconveniencing you. I hope you’re not angry. You seem really nice. Want to chat?”

Me “No”

Scammer “I’d love to grab dinner with you sometime. You seem really interesting”

Who is behind these texts and who is falling for them?!"
I tell them St Olaf stories from Golden Girls. The herring circus is my favorite.
"Once I recognize them for the scams they are I always pretend to recognize the name and ask the most embarrassing/tragic questions.

For instance one tried this and I responded ""Oh wow Janet, it's been a long time! I was sorry to hear about your family. 😢 How are the burn treatments going?""

After they sent me the creepy AI/filter ""selfies"" I started really complimenting their plastic surgeon and how you could barely tell she'd had third degree burns all over her face.

Basically playing a game of awkwardness chicken with them to see how far they're willing to go."
"Yeah, I've had wrong number stuff from the person that had my number before so it didn't strike me at first. Weird as hell when they keep trying to talk to you and go on about golf.

I'm not starving by any means, but I'm too poor to golf as a hobby. 

I also had one where they asked if I was okay. Didn't answer and a few weeks later they sent me a pic of a beautiful woman as though that would make me answer. Super obvious."
"i know two people that just recently fell for this. the one i couldn't convince him he was getting scammed and he got pig butchered.

the other one, it took a day and a bunch of us telling him he was being stupid that if he fell for it in the end, he wouldn't tell us."
"What about the ""I'm making Thai food tomorrow night. Want to come over?""... Closest ever I've been to responding to a spam text 😂"
Sadly my dad fell for this
"How do the scammers try to actually get money from someone?

Edit: I just watched the John Oliver segment on the ""Pig Slaughtering"" scam to get people to ""invest"" in crypto though a fake website or app.  I was curious because I have receive and replied to several ""wrong number"" texts that are the start of this kind of scam."
"Yep, I exactly this. I listened to a pretty good podcast about the pig slaughtering scam shortly after I found out he had been scammed. He lost $500 to a fake crypto site."
"I got one 2 weeks ago and my 40 year old daughter is still laughing about how long this ""woman"" kept me on the text chain before I realized it was probably a scam.  Yes, I'm a lonely old guy."
"I wrote back “oh Linda! How’s the leg?” 

They never wrote back."
Relevant [John Oliver](https://youtu.be/pLPpl2ISKTg?feature=shared) segment.
I’ve never understood how this scam works
"I always say ""send nudes or gtfo"". They never do... I wouldn't believe them if they did but there's no loss for not asking."
"This is why, as a gorgeous woman, I can never find anyone who wants to get to know me 😭"
You sound very nice. We can play golf next week if you’d like?
"Sure, i just need your help to get my uncle's fortune out of Nigeria"
"I play along until it seems the bot has transferred me to a real human, and then I send a link to the human trafficking help line."
"First time it happened to me I could understand why someone might fall for it. I didn't, but I get why. It sounded like a legit wrong number text (which is the point) and like I should let her know it's a wrong number because of the importance of the info. Then ""she"" said sorry, I live in LA, successful woman just trying to find a man, would you like to meet? I'll fly you out here etc etc. So fuckin stupid"
I got one of those one time about two years ago. I immediately realized it was a scam and decided to reply back because I was bored. They’re pretty fun to mess with if you are having a slow Tuesday. My wife thought the nudes were pretty photoshopped. I agreed.
I’m a girl. I have gotten that text couple of times.
I get the random text often. I text back wrong number and they always text back that I  seem nice and we should be friends. I'm not nice so they have very poor judgement of people.
"Sadly, I have a family member who fell for it. Don’t even ask me how much he lost from his bank account. 🤬 I was so sickened when I found out. She shared with me the pic of “her”. I told him, that’s not what “she” really looks like. UGH….. 

These predators need to have some karmic shit happen to them like fall down a man hole or get bit my a brown recluse spider. I know he’s responsible at the end of the day but these assholes are scamming naive people who just don’t know any better."
"I got a text like this a few days ago. ""Amy, do you want to play golf this weekend?""

I almost deleted it, but then just for the hell of it responded, ""Wrong number. No Amy here.""

I got a response that said something like, ""Oh, I must have typed in the wrong number. I am such a Careless Woman."" _then_ I deleted it. I thought about fucking with whoever it is, but decided it wasn't worth it."
"I used to mess with these people, and then I read a book on cryptocurrency that described how people are human trafficked and made to make these texts. I decided that I didn’t need to make their lives worse in case they were a literal slave, no matter how small the chance. "
"> I read a book on cryptocurrency 

I think I just read that book too, over the summer. Fascinating read."
"I got the first 1 of those 3 days ago. I'm 46, never ever before. Indidnt even know it was a woman till like 20 texts in i was just fuckingmoff on a wrong number.

I thoughtninwas fucking with them but then noticed they were trying to do the same lol"
"I got one the other day that started off appearing like a wrong number. I wasn’t rude, thinking it might be legit. Then came the ‘so you sound like a nice person…’ message. Nope. Reported as Junk, blocked, and deleted."
What’s up with this wrong number business? I thought I was the only one getting these. They want to be my friend?  Absolutely weird people out there! I wonder what they would say if I asked them for money? Nah
"It’s a crypto scam. They’ll play a long game to pretend they’re getting to know you, tell you about their supposed life etc. Then one day they’ll ask if you ever thought about investing in crypto"
Oh!! Thank you!
"Say/type ""Alaye"". It's a Nigerian word scammers use to identify each other so they don't waste their time. Or, keep fucking with 'em. Any time you waste of theirs is less time they'll spend bothering some gullible person, maybe."
"I always respond with 


""Donde estas la Bibliotheca?""


It just messes them up."
"Me llamo T-Bone, la araña discoteca"
Scammers starting to incorporate AI into spam texts. Every unknown text I get I delete or at least don’t respond to right away. 
I got a few of those earlier this year and said I had  no money and asked to borrow theirs.
[Like this? ](https://youtu.be/nTh9qpzhunE?t=40)
"I called one of these out using reverse google image search for the photo of ""them"" they sent me and they did not respond lol"
"I agree, but something like that happened to me on AIM. Some random person messeged me when I was in high school. I, honestly, don't remember why she messaged me, but we talked for a bit, and she ended up going to college in the next town over. We decided to meet up, dated for awhile. She ended up getting kicked out of school, so she had to move back with her parents from the close ish dorms, I drove the 45 minutes to her house, only to walk in on her fucking someone. We weren't exclusively dating, so fucking someone else would be fine, but she knew I was on my way over."
"I get those and love to troll them. When I think the ruse has gone long enough I say yes to whatever app or scam and then tell them to wait.

Then I block and ghost them."
"Oh yeah, it’s called Pig Butchering"
I made one of those scammers mad once on WhatsApp. Was pretty funny lol
"That's why I just send shock images, because it isn't a bot in most cases. They wanna see a pic? I send goatse."
The [pig butchering scam](https://youtu.be/pLPpl2ISKTg?si=8tCzvoNpPxhpky9j). It’s crazy people fall for it!
"It must have happened, because all such scams are based on real situations that are easy to exploit. So about 0.000000001% of cases are actual people. See, there's a chance."
My stepdad think he has a harem od 23 yr old Latinas pining after him
"I keep getting texts like these but they’re about horses. Questions about riding lessons, someone looking for a horse doctor….I’m so confused"
Glad you didn’t specify any gorgeous woman. It’s truly any woman 😂
I have yet to get one of these . I want to soo badly so I fuck with them
I always say I'm a text answering service for a medical complex. One got super pissed at me one time.
I love these. I just string them along and measure with them until they want to switch to what’s app.
"I usually string these along. However, last week I did and then I got a bunch of text messages/voicemails from their so-called “pimps” telling me that I made his “bitch” run off. Now, I owe him $2500 or he’s going to kill me and my family. Yeah, it’s still a scammer, but it was kind of scary. He sends me videos of piles of dead bodies and guys speaking through masks. They think they have my address which isn’t even close, but I can see how they could really scare someone into emptying their bank account into them."
Get one at least once a month.
"Omg I got one of those the other day! First time ever. 

My old neighbor in Chicago was spending like 2k a month on random ""girls"" he'd ""meet"" on Facebook."
Unless they have CTE
"Never trust a beautiful woman…especially one who’s interested in you.
—Magneto—"
I once received a text like this from a woman who talked in fluent American and became Chinese-Amierican as I engaged more. Literally like this scene in family guy [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6HE2kdj6Zc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6HE2kdj6Zc)
"No lie, this just happened to me today. I truly don't understand how people fall for this."
"Every random text I get I just send back ""send nudes"". Either I get nudes or get ignored lol"
"Dang, I don’t get those texts. That would be so fun to have someone to talk to."
Me too. I'm a bit envious of all these posts. Might break up the monotony of my day.
Ah shit. I forgot I got one of those today and I was supposed to fuck with them.
I always tell them to just be cautious because I’m under investigation by the FBI and all my conversations are under total scrutiny.
"This. A coworker showed me one of those ""accidental"" texts and told him I guarantee you that it's some type of scam."
"Coworker got one of those. Talked to him all about crypto and walked him through starting a crypto wallet. Of course he gave her the password so she could help. Couple hundred dollars later the account is empty and she won't respond to his texts. He's still investing in crypto because ""it sounded like a good way to make money""."
"I got a varriant where the chick acclaims she got my number via friend. Wouldn't say what friend. Said she doesn't do socials & wanted to marry me & have 14 kids

When I blocked the fake number, instantly got a text asking if I didn't like her form a diff number"
"Yeah, I got one of those a few months back. The moment a wrong number attempts to keep a conversation going, you know its going to be a scam. I hadnt seen the scam before, so I decided to stay on the line and see how the script worked, pretending to play along.

part 1: an “assistant” acts as a filter to vet suckers. If you look like a hot prospect, they pass you off to their “boss” and then try to get you onto a whatsapp conversation which is encrpyted and set to terminate messages after 90 days. This is to make evidence collection in a lawsuits discovery phase much more difficult, as well as make it harder to backtrace the scammers ID and location.

part 2: the “hook”. The scammer tries to build rapport and entice you with a potential relationship while also bragging about their lavish lifestyle, showing off their house and car in beverly hills. They are in the “import” business and make most of their money from “investments”. They are generous, claiming to go to charity galas and donating $50,000.

 part 3: the “bait”. They want to share their passion for investing with you. What kind of investing? oh, just trading short term options on the forex market for precious metals, specifically “gold”. They show off their latest trades which appear to be very profitable. “Wow, you will help me do that too?!??” is what they want you to ask. They are more than happy to help. You ask “How do you time the market so well?!” and the lady says her old aunt has an algorithm that detects signals in the market and she wants to share those with you…

part 4: the “scam”. She tells you to open an investing account on some shady looking webpage. It asks you to give all your banking info, do an ACH to fund your “investing” account. The website is shady as fuck. You do like 5 minutes of due dilligence and its obviously scammy. Anyways, presumably you “fund” the account and then you get an invest “signal”, go all in, and low and behold the fake market goes upside down and you lose all your money. In reality, you were already robbed the moment you funded the account, but they just need some flimsy pretext to take your money from you."
"I got one from someone pretending they were trying to text their vet because their dog was sick.  It ALMOST got me talking, until about an hour later, and they texted me a picture of them and their pooch that was miraculously fine, and it was so obviously staged/edited/not real that I realized it was a scammer trying to get personal info from me."
I got one of those a few months ago. My wife and I had some fun with it.
I mess with these folks all the time. Practically a hobby at this point.
"I kept one of them on the line for a few days, said they just wanted a friend. But like....a text outta nowhere trying to develop a friendship is weird no matter how hot they are.

Plus I'm old and married and I don't need my wife wondering why I'm texting some baddie. 

""Fuckin up your fo sho pussy tryna get some mo pussy, end up with no pussy"" - some song idk"
I get loads of these. I spend ages winding them up until they block me.
"I swear to fucking god, I got one of those texts *the day my wife went into labor*.

We both got a good laugh out of it, but seriously, what are the odds?"
"I had a conversation with one of those and I knew it was a scam, so I started sending memes to them. They stopped responding after the 3rd one"
I keep asking them if pineapple belongs on pizza. They never give me an answer :(
There’s a similar scene in “Mom” where a guy dialed the wrong number but they kept talking and long story short they’re married!
"You just want all the ""sexy local singles"" to your self."
Has anyone received one asking about a bra that was left poolside? This one really cracked me up.
"i used to mess with them but im pretty sure its just a.i. so thay got boring quick. ended up with more random ""wanna meet for dinner"" texts. i just block em now"
These ones are starting to get more clever. My fiancé got a text from someone asking about some specific event (I can't remember what it was) and it seemed to be a wrong number text. He texted back to say it was the wrong number and then the scammer/bot thanked him and then started with the 'I want to get to know you' thing and she/he/it was immediately blocked.
"Wait, so who’ve I been sending money to…?"
No gorgeous ones anyway...
I had an old lady text me by accident then wanted to be friends. Bulllshit
Those one always made me laugh. I would entertain them for all of a second then I ignore them. You can tell they are clearly fishing for information. They try so hard to be extra friendly and such to the point of being suspious.
99.99999% of the time you are right but I used to work with a guy in about 2013 who literally met his wife this way.
"There are many people with NPD or people that score somewhat high on the narcissist traits that simply want armcandy or a trophy wife/hubs.

They can’t fathom being scammed.

No way! They are successful and hella attractive! And they deserve a successful and/or beautiful partner! 

They have always dated 5’s and now they want to date a 9 and a 10! Even well in their 40’s they think they can pull a 20 year old OF MODEL! 

Yes! Believe it!"
Check out what I had for lunch.
"Actually, yeah they do. We had phone sex once a year and that was the only time she ever called me. I believe it was the start of her bipolar cycle. Then I lost the phone number to the police.

I believe that it was because I also had an American phone number thanks to an S.I.P. number so it's not that weird. She actually genuinely could have just misdialed and I mean she never asked for anything. Me and me gave me anything. Well she did ask for some things but I was very happy to give them. They weren't financial and I mean I got some things in return but very strange relationship that one


We just found each other's voice hot like we both had a thing for voices and we both had the perfect accent for each other"
"I got one once where I still about half feel like... Maybe she was real lol. Didn't try to flirt or anything. Just a wrong number supposedly. She invited me to her art exhibition, but it was in New York City and I live in the Midwest. Just seemed genuine friendly but I know it was probably some sort of scam."
About 10 years ago now I actually did get a text from a random woman and actuality met up and slept with her. I'm kind of sad for all these young guys now getting scammed by this.
"I would normally just ignore and if possible block (not worth doing it for texts the number was probably randomly spoofed anyhow), but I got one on Signal so I engaged a little bit in case it was actually a lead for a news story. But it only took a couple of messages to confirm it was just spam."
"I still constantly get these friend requests where it's some very attractive woman with 3-4 photos (some of which aren't even the same person) and 5 friends.

When I see one of them is one of my friends it tells me a lot about that person."
"I got one of those and when I said I wasn't the person they were looking for I got the ""I'm sorry for bothering you"" spiel and I immediately knew it was some sort of scam even though I had not heard of this scam yet."
"i got one of these on a Friday evening around 7pm that said ""Hey do you have time to go to the gym with me""

I replied with ""its fucking friday evening and your asking me to go to the gym?! no true friend of mine would ever request this, fuck off"""
"I’ve gotten those before. The one time I told her she had the wrong number, and she still tried to chat me up. I proceeded to ask them how big of a butt plug they thought I could fit in my ass."
My hope and dreams are crushed wth
"I got one couple of weeks ago asking if I wanted homemade Asain food. I was stoked! Of course I do! Oh, you're in Cali, and I'm not? Pity. What's the recipe? Here's my recipe! Also, if you're in the mood for something non Asain, here's my family recipe for chitlins and fried gizzards. If you're ever on the East Coast, let me know, and I'll bring you over to my family for dinner. 

In short, I always make them feel guilty. I would absolutely cool for them if they were even remotely close, which they're not. But, I just make myself human to them. They go away."
"I've gotten a few of these. I just say ""Wrong number. Not interested"" and then delete and block. "
"I got one once and said ""where's the 5K you owe me?  They didn't respond."
I love fuckin with those scammers.
Never say never! My dad met his third wife via a mis-addressed email.
Can someone tell me the end game of these scams?
Ok sometimes we are real about this one. 😂. At least I have been
Multi level marketing schemes. We have literally so much information now about how they are predatory. It’s disgusting how a lot of them target low income mothers who feel guilty about spending time away from home to work and earn a living.
"In the early 2000’s, I went to a party with a then coworker at this older coworker couples’ house that nobody knew very well.  It was a beautiful suburban house. Once everyone was feeling pretty good from drinks at around 10pm, they said, “Do you want the tour?” We all grabbed a drink and went on the tour, which ended in the basement, where there was a big stock room of vitamins and supplements, and a giant poster (and somewhat of a shrine) of a sketchy guy in a leather blazer with an 80’s haircut. I started laughing and said, “What the f*** is all this, and who the f*** is that?!”  

We sell supplements, and that’s (name) who started the company. He was tragically murdered by his wife (bow heads in sorrow).  I was like, “Whaaaaat?!”  Anyway, then came the sales pitch about these revolutionary supplements, getting in early and how much they’ve made. Everyone just awkwardly declined. Then we went back upstairs and nobody spoke of it the rest of the night.  

I ran into an old coworker recently and he brought it up. One of the weirdest situations I’ve ever found myself in. The couple moved to the west coast and apparently had an ugly divorce."
"I have a similar story! 

We went to what we thought was a house warming party. Only one other guest. The wife spent a lot of time on the phone asking people if they were on their way. Weird, but my husband, the other host and I opened the wine we brought and it was awkward but not terrible. We tried to make conversation with the small group when suddenly the wife told us it was time for the presentation and then puts on a demonstration with Norwex, cleaning towels with “Bac-lock technology.” She even used a raw egg to show the bacteria cleaning power. I won a free Norwex wash cloth somehow and during a lull in the presentation, my husband stood up, said we had to leave and we basically ran out while she chased us with the free cloth and the open bottle of wine to give back to us."
I deliver Norwex boxes to people (carrier) and it pains me to know I've just spotted another MLM dummy.
"Norwex is an MLM? Lol I got one for Christmas once, had no idea. Although the person who gave it to me is hardcore into MLMs so that checks out"
Yup. It seems built to prey on people's unrealized germ phobia.
[deleted]
If I didn't take the blame being the last one handling it...
"Mlm or not they are great products. (I don’t buy or sell it, I just have used it while living with someone in the past)"
"> she chased us with the free cloth and the open bottle of wine

Well at least it was easy for her to clean up the wine she spilled."
Fr I was picturing this crazy lady waving a towel in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other spilling everywhere. “Wait! Waaaaaiiiiiit!”
I went to a dinner party where this crazy lady tried to sell us her Serenity candles. Unbelievably awkward night. She sang us country songs and smashed her boyfriend’s flat screen tv.
Well that right there is worth the price of admission.
"They almost always disguise these events as otherwise noone would show up. Girls pamper night etc.

Reminds me of time share meetings except you go into those knowing 'ill get free stuff then leave' except people overestimate their ability to turn away master manipulators"
You just bullshit them right back.  They can't call you out without saying that they know you're full of shit because game recognizes game.  I like to pretend to be rich and very interested and I get all their info and tell them my money manager will call them by Friday.  They know I'm lying.  It's lots of fun!
[deleted]
That is marvelous
"Ok, it looks like I misremembered the details a bit, and my timelines seem off, but I believe the tool on the poster was this guy, who went to jail for trying to hire someone to kill his wife: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2618944/amp/EXCLUSIVE-Millionaire-tycoon-solitary-confinement-inmates-offer-pay-visit-rat-hitman-secretly-taped-offering-80-000-model-wife-murdered.html"
That makes it even weirder that they had a photo of him still in their house.
"My favorite part: 

“Creation’s Garden, which once employed 250 staff, was sold off at auction.

Monica is now trying to re-launch her arm of the business, which included 52 beauty creams and baby skin care products.”"
My friend threw me an mlm bachelorette party. Didn't know that's what it was until it started. It was one of those sex toy ones but that was still not what I was expecting. My sister saved it when she got ahold of a double ended dildo and started whipping it around like some midieval weapon and accidentally clocked my cousin in the head with it.
"I attended a MonaVie meeting because some girl that I was hanging out was roped into it. I knew immediately it was a scam or at the very least a pyramid scheme. 

A lot of people don't realize that even if it is not a ""scam"" you will spend all your time burning family relationships and friendships hard selling this shit. Then you will be known as the person to avoid because you are always hard selling, or you owe them money, or it is awkard bc you said know etc."
"Oh my god, my mom is weirdly into Norwex. Thankfully she doesn’t sell it, she just thinks they’re nice towels."
"I did keep the wash cloth. I was too stunned not to take it. And even though we were running away, I didn’t want to make her feel bad/worse. It made it into our rotation. It’s fine."
"Same. But I cringe when my mom talks about how she feels good ""helping"" this woman with her business. No mom, you are just extending her delusions. The earlier she gets out, the better."
Oh my mom is under no illusions about it helping anyone lmao
yeah as long as she sticks to only buying them lolol
"I have a story. I was 19 and got a landscaping job. The owner was super cool and he had a nice route of customers that were very wealthy. Huge manicured properties. One day after work ended he invited me and the other guy that worked for him to dinner at his house to discuss business. We thought he meant like growing the landscaping business.

  
We were served Mac and cheese and a hot dog and afterwards they brought out this book of famous away millionaires. It was basically a huge bound fancy book with huge pictures of properties and boats and cars and a blurb under each one detailing how so and so made it all happen with Amway. They told us they were going to be rich and they wanted us to be rich too.

We politely declined. I quit at the end of the summer but kept in touch with my coworker. Turned out the owner kept putting money into tapes, books, etc etc from his away upstream manager or whatever and bankrupted his business.

  
He was a really hard working nice guy. It definitely taught me a lesson."
[deleted]
What is SAHM?
Sad angry house maid?
Stay at home mom
It is an MLM totally but I actually really like their washcloths. I don’t pay for or sell them. My mom’s friend is a sucker for all MLM and she gives me them for Christmas.
"If anyone pretending to be a friend pulls mlm on me during what I think is a hang out, they are dead to me. That’s so disrespectful and rude."
[removed]
"You’re right. You also realize that some people, even people I knew who were relatively smart and good at work, can easily be influenced and manipulated. My friend and I were laughing and saying, “No fucking way”, but I know there were people who got involved after that night. You think of if you have 20 people, and 10% fall for it, that’s 2 new moneymakers for you."
At least a Tupperware party was a) above-board and honest and b) a product not available in stores at the time. Sheesh.
"My wife was part of a friend group where one of the ""higher tiered"" members decided to host a zoom cocktail party (during covid). I was sitting offscreen laughing my ass off, because her friendly catching-up- with-the-gals zoom session turned out to just be an MLM presentation of beauty products. Whatever company that promises a white Mercedes to their high performing reps.

The funny thing was that everyone was too polite NOT to buy anything, since most them were already very much into the scene of massive Sephora hauls or monthly subscription box self-care. I think my wife bought like a $20 moisturizer that she used on me."
How did your wife “use” it on you?  😉
"I worked with a guy in an IT shop that was always awkwardly trying to make friends with me. He was an alright guy, but totally not someone I'd make friends with. He started inviting my wife and I to come to dinner, and I kept declining, telling him we don't do social things with co-workers. He finally got around to telling me he wanted me to become his ""partner"" in his MLM scheme. This was like 30 years ago. It was an Amway pitch. I got really pissed off and told him that lying to get people to listen to your sales pitch is really unethical. Then this tool says, ""Well you and your wife could still come over"". Naw dude, I have zero interest in you or being your ""buddy""."
I think i might be rude because I call ppl out for stuff like this.
"They're looking for marks
Who don't have well a developed sense for manipulation. Or who are used to it. 

A woman I dated had a narcissistic mom who played mind games with her for her whole life. 

She fell for several MLMs and insisted that she met the most caring and friendly people there. She couldn't detect the subtle manipulation. And she also was lured in by the ""community"" and ""friends"" because they tell you in their huge rallies that you're surrounded by your new life long friends. Everyone smile and meet each other. Exchange numbers and make Facebook groups... 

None of those people stuck around in her life. "
All the SAHMs in my town got sucked into various MLMs in the early 2000s and my mom would drag me along those obvious ambush parties because she could count on me to get bored and start misbehaving and then use that as an excuse to leave.
"My most awkward was my sister in-law. 

We were staying at her place. She was the model target, young mother who didn't want to work outside of the house. Hopelessly naive. 

The really awkward part is that it was right in the morning, and I hadn't had any coffee or really woke up yet. 

So, I come downstairs and the whole family is sitting around the living room, and they're all drinking these weird off-brand energy drinks. So, being still asleep, I just assumed this was something they were into, and so she starts talking them up and showing me the different flavors and all that. 

I looked them over and said 'Can I just make a pot of regular coffee? I'm not really into energy drinks.' 

My wife sort of mumbled 'She's selling them ...' under her breath and I had an even weirder moment to process where I thought she wanted me to buy drinks she bought at the store from her? 

I got up and made coffee, and during that process, she'd gone on with her pitch and it dawned on me that she'd bought something like 100 cases of this crap and now had to offload it, and hopefully sign people up to sell it as well. 

It was just sad, and I felt bad for making it worse."
Best story on here yet. Your confusion and the long burn till you realized what was happening sounds like something out of Seinfeld. Made me laugh
"10 years ago I was looking for a job and a friend I made volunteering told me that a friend of hers that wanted to talk to me about a job opportunity. Man i was so excited told my mom, got ready in my lil business suit only to arrive with said friend in tote to some ITWORKS bs spiel that she knew about. I was livid. They didn't understand my unwillingness to drop 100$ on a starter pack when i didn't have a job. They were dependas so bless them they probably forgot civilians actually need jobs with consistent pay"
"Same thing happened to me! But instead of supplements it was candles they were selling. The wife had a room full of them, the smell was overwhelming. My dorky coworker agreed but I declined. After that the couple had a huge fight and she shattered the screen on his plasma TV (he was really proud of it). The cops were called and we all had to go home. We never got to eat the Osso Buco, it still had another 2 hours to cook. I ended up snagging a CD from a hip new artist, Hunter, he's really talented."
"I was looking for marketing jobs straight out of college and applied to a bunch of job openings. Me being very green I didn't get a lot of replies, so I was naturally excited to get invited to a ""job interview"". I forget what they said they did exactly, but I imagine it was designed to be vague enough to get me there.

Once there the other shoe dropped pretty quickly. There were a bunch of balding ""CEO type"" business men talking about some powdered energy drink and how it had changed their life. I sat through their presentation for some reason and made my exit quickly after. They kept hounding me over the phone for a couple of days, saying they ""really saw something special in me"", before giving up.

I just kept thinking what a sad existence those guys had scamming naive people straight out of college. Years later I'm still angry about the wasted time."
"I worked in a grocery store with a guy (Josh) who fell into a MLM selling energy drinks. These were obviously the BEST energy drinks and you couldn't buy them in any store, only from salesmen. 

He was so convinced that it was going to work out that he repeatedly told everyone he'd be retiring the following year because he'd be making so much money. He tried to get me on board and just for shits, I actually did call the guy running the scam-- damn if he didn't sound like every single fast-talking shyster you've seen in a movie. Slick, snobbish and made sure to tell me about his motorcycle and his convertible. All from selling energy drinks, I guess. I had purchased one-- it was expensive and it tasted like shit!


Years later, after I had moved on from the store, I was back there shopping and there was Josh, stocking energy drinks."
You should have asked if the supplements can protect you from being murdered by your spouse.
"It's like that movie *Go.*

Super underrated."
"In my early 20s a dude I knew was REALLY into one of these.  He asked once and we said no thanks.  Didn't think much of it.

Then he wanted to get drinks with us one night and showed up with a binder...

We didn't hang after that.  He was legit mentally unstable.  Could NOT follow his thought processes.  It was scary."
"Completely bizarre,😵‍💫.  What people will do to earn a so-calledy living 🤔🤨"
"Yep I lost a friend over it. I’d moved from my old neighborhood and she invited me for dinner one night to catch up. It was an Herbalife sales pitch with her husband and kids at the table. I cried all the way home because we’d been such good friends, and she wasn’t interested in anything I’d been doing."
"I'm sorry, that would be so sad.😪"
"It really was. She’d been with me through so many things over the years and it really hurt. Thing is, I had a bad feeling about because we hadn’t spoken much in a while, and she contacted me out of the blue with a kind of enthusiasm uncharacteristic of her. Her husband was uncomfortable with it but just sat there. I still check her Facebook occasionally and it’s still full of posts for that stuff, and this has been about 10 years now."
Wow. I thought they all learned the hard way after just 2 or 3 years.
Same story except it was my own sister. She offered to host a family party so she could pitch us.

I loved the show “On Becoming a God in Central Florida” about Kristin Dunst’s character going through the highs and lows of being in an MLM. It was hilarious.
Yes! Loved that show!
"It really was a good show! Having grown up in Orlando in the 90s, being raised by a single mom, I loved it with all my heart. 💛 💚💜"
"Aaww, that is so sweet. It sounds like those were good times for you."
I mean it’s like any upbringing it was good and bad. But the show definitely felt like home as a result.
"~2000 SoCal, ""Pre Paid Legal"" I used to sell weed to a bunch of knuckleheads that were PPL synchophants, I agreed to go to one of their ""meetings"" where all they do is try and brainwash new people. Ate a bunch of food and left with like 5+ new customers.

Overall win 🏆 I guess. 

Edit [I forgot]: also SoCal ~2006 now wife's parents went bankrupt when they drank the Xango kool-aid"
"This reminded me of the MLM-peddling cop from ""Go"" -- a fun turn of the millennium movie about raver kids. Priceless scene."
"Similar story but with skin products.

It was a childhood friend that I had and we would see each other regularly after graduating high school, just for dinner and hanging out at the mall, etc. She said she wanted to invite me for a special dinner with her family and I said sure! I've had dinner with her family before so, I thought nothing of it.

  
It turned out to be a very weird meeting with a similar sales pitch and it felt very ""culty"" and I politely declined. Then she slowly stopped being friends with me and was basically avoiding me, which sucks. No idea what she's up to these days!"
"not a story just like this, but kinda... 

  
I'd been on the lookout for another job, like a fore really real job...was feeling burned out at my current spot. 

  
Well a lady at a local, big named, papermill called me and was like ""I want to talk to you when you get off, it's something that you may be interested in""...I knew there was a spot open in her department at the mill, per Indeed, and I assumed that's what she was talking about. 

  
I call her when I'm done for the day and she goes on about her and her husband and I'm like ""ugh""...then her husband pops on the phone and he's like ""let me play you this recording"" 

  
🙄🙄🙄

  
it was for damn team national. 

  
I still don't understand the point of that shit 😂"
"I also had a similar experience. I was in college and this girl invited me to a house party. I assumed, since it's college, that it was gonna be a standard rager. 

I get there and there's little snacks and stuff. Fine. Maybe it's too early to lose our minds? Then I noticed that all of the guests were female. My dumbass thought, ""Great! No weirdos!""

And then a notably older woman in a pants suit announces that it's time for the presentation... she pulls out a suitcase full of sex toys. I was shocked. I had to literally bite my tongue to prevent myself from bursting out laughing. 

It took maybe an hour and then I managed to leave. It was so wildly akward."
"Maybe everyone has one of these uncomfortable MLM stories.  My then-husband and I were visiting his step-mother's brother at a fun get together.  At the end of the party, the brother's daughter and her husband asked if they could visit us at our house.  We were really surprised because we really didn't know them, but we agreed.  So they came over and tried to sign us up to sell frigging AMWAY!  We were captive in our own house!  We were so mad, but didn't kick them out because they were related to my husband's step-mother who we adored. Ugh, I am still pissed off about that and it was 30 years ago!"
"What's crazy is how little math you need to realise they're a scam, since the numbers are right there on their pamplets. Often it's like:

* 1 billion total revenue last year!

* 1 million independent business owners!

Wow, impressive numbers!... hang on.... That's an average of $1,000 per year. And that's revenue. If we be generous and assume you make 20% profit and spend only an hour a week on the ""business"", you're earning less than $4/hour. 

And that's average. We are shown stories of people earning thousands of dollars per month. That just drags the median way down. 

SMH."
What little math you just did in this post is still well beyond the people who fall prey to these scams. A lot of folks just generally have difficulty parsing large numbers; you start talking about millions and billions and a significant number of people just can’t accurately conceptualize how big those numbers actually are and what they really mean. That’s why these scams are evergreen
"And even if they figure that one out, then there's the second stumbling block--so many people genuinely believe they're the exception. ""That's just the average, so I just need to put in above average hustle. Most people probably just do this as a hobby and bring the average down...""

People will rationalize all kinds of irrational behavior."
I saw the million and billion and I’m ready to sign up.
"Also don’t underestimate the power of self confidence or main character syndrome or whatever you want to call it. Basically yeah all these other people failed because they didn’t think of this one clever idea that will make me successful. Or even less thought out, I’m better than those people. I’ll figure this out. I’ll be the exception and make a fortune! It’s usually the most gullible who think they’re the smartest person in the room."
"It's why so many Americans think billions of dollars for massive instructure peirce are a scam. I'm like - my man - residential construction costs $1000psf here in CA in parts, so a big kitchen /fanily room renovation can cost $500k, a house $1.5m in construction costs. Don't you expect a statewide rail system to cost more than a few thousand houses? No - a billion is a big number. Oh nvm. SMH.....

You're spot on."
"Hahaha! I live in California,  so I guess it's not funny. But realistically, the only places you find costs that high are highly desirable places with limited homes for sale at any one time. Think Newport Beach, Malibu, San Francisco."
"Bay area for sure. Settled a little bit but ellectrical, hvac, and plumbing can go for $150, $300, $350/hr respectively in the prehistoric with the vendors here."
"My older brother fell for one right out of high school, and you literally could not have imagined a more street smart and educated teenager. He got our family onto the internet and was voted Most Witty in his senior yearbook. Obviously he's not the main customer base of the average MLM, but my point is that we're all teenagers in some areas of life and we could all be duped easily enough by the right trick."
"I'm so disheartened with how bad the education system in America is. I have had to explain basic math concepts to people who have grown up connected to the internet their entire lives and could have easily just taught themselves and they just haven't. I once worked at a business  that used part-time teens for basic labor tasks and I had to stop the teen employees multiple times from giving someone a 90% discount when they meant 10% several times. We kept a calculator right there on the counter, but a few didn't know how to use it. I taught several people who were nearly grown adults with driver's licenses how to use a calculator to do basic math. 

For the curve-ball out of left field, I quit that job because one of the managers, a creepy hobbit looking dude in his 30's, was sleeping with a 17-year-old employee, which isn't illegal in our state because the age of consent is 17, but it creeped me the fuck out that nobody else had a problem with it, so I quit."
That's scary.
"Even if they do end up doing the math, their math skills are generally so bad that they'll just assume they did the math wrong because the numbers don't add up and they'll just ignore the dealership-sized red flag they just figured out."
"my dad concluded that improper fractions was the median math concept.  that is half of america can't deal with not ""solving"" improper fractions."
"I don't understand your sentence structure. I think you are using ""was"" instead of ""were"" and then added a period, an ""is' and a double negative. 

  
Show your comment to your dad, ask him if you are above the median."
"You're overcomplicating it. It was meant to be two sentences. ""Was"" *is* correct, because it is referring to the *singular* concept of ""improper fractions"". ""That is"" is an idiom, an abbreviated form of the phrase ""that is to say"", which would normally be offset from the rest of the sentence with a comma or a colon. It means that whatever follows is a more precise expression of whatever was just said.

~~Agreed about the double negative.~~ Never mind, see below!

~~Fix the double negative,~~ expand the idiom, and you get this:

>My dad concluded that improper fractions was the median math concept. That is to say, half of America can't deal with not ""solving"" improper fractions.

That any clearer?"
">     That is to say, half of America can't deal with ""solving"" improper fractions.
> 
You changed the meaning. The point was that the people can't deal with leaving an improper fraction ""unsolved"". That's what the purpose of the ""not"" was before ""solving""."
"Ah, I see. On that particular point I had been agreeing with the person I replied to that there was likely a double-negative in there, because it had seemed to me that the comment was trying to say that half the population can't solve improper fractions. But you're right, the scare quotes around ""solving"" imply that your interpretation is the correct one. I will fix."
 The dude's dad would also love to teach him capital letters but unfortunately half of their family can't deal with them.
Rewrite his sentence for us if you know the better way
His dad thinks half of America can do improper fractions.
"It's 'well beyond' me and I am an MA graduate. I just don't think that way. I'd not have joined an MLM despite this, for a myriad of other reasons but I can completely see why others who would, would not sit down to number crunch first."
"1 million seconds = 2 weeks
1 billion seconds = 35 years
1 trillion seconds = 35'000 years"
"It happens as soon as you start using words instead of numbers.  People have a hard time dividing between two different ""units""."
"Some people also just don't think they need math at all. One time I just mentioned on Reddit that basic algebra is a very beneficial skill for every person to know. Someone came at me what seemed with emotion debating that you certainly don't need that. Well, yeah, if you wanna live life on hard mode."
"> A lot of folks just generally have difficulty parsing large numbers; you start talking about millions and billions and a significant number of people just can’t accurately conceptualize how big those numbers actually are and what they really mean. That’s why these scams are evergreen

Humans aren't really made to understand magnitude. You ever do that silly thought experiment, where someone asks you if you would take a one month job, at 1¢ on day one, if the money doubled every day? Many people don't understand that on day 30 alone, you would be paid $5+ mil, let alone what you add to it from previous days. I think it totals to ~$11 mil.

This is why religion gets away with talking about ""forever"", because *humans don't understand magnitude*."
I was with you up until your last sentence.
Math is hard.
Simple division and multiplication shouldn't be.
"I taught 9th grade.  I had a student tell me outright that if I used numbers bigger than 100, she couldn't understand them. 

There are people who literally can't comprehend that $100,000 and $100,000,000,000 are different amounts of money, because both of them are ""a lot of money""."
"Oh, that's sad."
She was not the slowest person in that class...
"Could you use like... 1,000 marbles or something?"
Open calculator and slowly do the math for them.
"It’s true that a lot of people don’t understand the math, but also MLMs are very sophisticated at manipulating and indoctrinating their members. They prey on lonely, disconnected stay at home parents. Then they provide a “family” with positive messages for their victims to become emotionally invested, and lie about their ability to succeed. And they have scripts upon scripts for quashing any disagreement or dissent. It’s really a well-established cult philosophy."

"I did the math on the Paparazzi five-dollar jewelry business ""opportunity."" I made more as a part-time pizza delivery driver at 20 hours a week than those women would make (net profit) at 80 hours a week."
And you didn’t have to harass all your friends and family!
"More than anything that's the part I can't get past.  I can't bring myself to ask family or friends for legitimate help when I need it, let alone sell them garbage to make a profit.  I'd be so embarrassed, especially when it became clear that it was all bullshit.  Like, how do they not feel ashamed or at least weird about it?"
"Wait, is that all it takes to get your family to leave you alone? Holiday season upcoming, brb making some calls."

It depends if they had cut a hole in the pizza box or not ;)
My aunt has been doing Paparazzi for years. Swears by it. Loves the company and all the conferences they do and the trips she gets to go on. But she is broke because she spends all her money on her stock and all the trips and conferences she has to go to.

"Aren't most of them just selling the product to each other, too?

The whole sell behind a pyramid scheme is that you buy product from the person who recruited you, and then recruit people to do direct sales for you (because there's no money in direct sales).

Are they counting the dozens of 'independent business owners' selling things to each other as individual transactions?"
"Oh but THEY'LL be one of the above average earners, just you wait and see!"
And they require you to make a $1000 initial investment to buy the products you are going to resell.
"> What's crazy is how little math you need to realise they're a scam, since the numbers are right there on their pamplets. Often it's like:

That's because it's a quick and efficient filter, removing anyone who's not a good candidate to be defrauded from the get-go. Really saves the fraudsters a ton of money and time."
Hmmmm. I hadn't thought of it like that. You could be onto something. But aren't they then worried that the smart people will warn their friends?
People who can pass through this filter won't hear the voices of reason either.
"It’s amazingly obvious when you put it like that. 

A long time ago I worked at a software company and one year it was a big deal because we finally cleared $1B in revenue. Entire company was about 3000 people and sales department was about 400."
"Right? I thought I'd have to do some digging to find actual numbers, but there were there for all to see. I also had to double check because I thought they wouldn't so obviously display what a bad prospect it was like that. But of course, when I pointed this out to my acquaintance, he was all ""well yeah, not everyone commits fully, you have to have to have the right mindset to succeed, blah blah bullshit."""
"Technically, a few people making a lot wouldn’t really move the median, but rather the average; and it would move up. I think what you mean is that the average reflects a handful of successful people, necessarily meaning that most make jack shit."
"Yeah, you're right, that's a better way of putting it."
"Big numbers mean people lose the ability to do math, even when it's fairly simple math."
"Lured in by a job opportunity, but the moment they started asking me to pay hundreds of dollars just to enroll and then a monthly subscription of 100 more, it's not a job opportunity anymore."
Becomes even sadder when you realize that most of the revenue is actually generated by the top 15-20%.

"Work does events for a company, I don't approve but they do massive events and bring in people from all over. I would assume they are paying to be there, but I saw people getting over a million dollar bonuses, but absolutely the top people in their regions / country. 


I will add this was an event in an arena seating 18k people and had a massive production, along with another venue with 2000 people and a massive production. 


It's shocking how much they make."
"They literally share the income disclosures that show the majority make very little, if anything…and people still sign up!"
"I know, right? I thought I'd have to do some digging to show how silly the whole thing is. But they put it right in their advertising material. 

Another commenter suggested this might be to filter out the people who can do simple math, which is... scary. The others see BILLIONS and are impressed, or think that they will be the one to make it because of their success mindset."
"When I was 19 and still naive, I was approached by a super charismatic guy offering a great way to make money on the side. As a broke college kid of course I was interested. He went into detail about these 3rd party products, everyday things like toothpaste, toilet paper, laundry detergent, etc. and ""all I had to do"" was get people to start using these products. Still trying to genuinely understand, my first question was ""How do I convince people to switch from their trusted brands to something they've never heard of?"" 

He completely deflected and went into how I can be my own boss and set my own hours and recruit other people. That quickly shattered my rose-colored glasses and I became a lot more vigilant with ""opportunities"" after that. 

It really only takes a few basic questions to completely unravel their sales pitch."
"I got hit up for a literal pyramid scheme my Freshman year in college with a guy from one of my classes. He explained the rules and showed me the list of people who were paying $100 each or whatever and funneling the money up towards the top. My immediate thoughts even as a dumb 18-year-old were:

1. Eventually you run out of people at the bottom.

2. There's nothing really stopping anyone from just making up names and putting themselves at essentially the top of a new pyramid."
"lol I feel like this is a near universal experience for college freshmen.

The guy I responded to had JOB POSTING on Indeed for a position that paid $15/hr plus commission. When I ""interviewed"" it felt more like a sales pitch so that immediately put me off. When I asked ""how am I getting the $15/hr if all I'm doing is selling things? Does that come from you?"" and he was like ""ooh no I just put that as an estimate to how much you'll be making.

Total scam. Glad I didn't have the $300 needed for the initial package cause that made for an easy out to the ""interview."""
Yep I went through the Cutco interview. On top of having to buy all the knives (at a steep discount!) and only making commission I knew I didn't know that many people to pawn this shit off on.
"Yep, I got roped into an interview for one. Some random dude spoke at the beginning of one of my classes about this great summer internship opportunity that pays really well.

"It is a thing to prey on the young college students. In my school it was a bunch of fliers bombed on a freshman chemistry class. Put my email to see how I could make $10-20k in a summer.

It was selling SAT/ACT prep material and they send you out of state for it. They got groups of us to meet in a library to talk about it and when I started asking questions she pulled me aside and asked me to leave. My girlfriend at the time got wrapped up in it without me knowing it was the same thing at the time and had a horrible experience. They had her travel on her own halfway across the US with ""alumni housing"" so someone else who was suckered into it. And the expectation she would find housing. It was considered sales though, because you didn't buy the product first. You know, they just isolate you from your family and friends so this is the only thing you have to do with your free time in the summer. Well the kicker is, she wasn't allowed to sell in suburban neighborhoods, which are the only place I feel like that crap would sell. So I think instead of the $10k she thought she was going to make she was out like $800 in car repairs for driving a piece of junk that far, and whatever gas was required."
"John Oliver did a but on MLMs where he showed that ""and then they grab 2 friends..."" runs out of people by the 15th? cycle.

"I remember one going around my school when I was about 13/14.

you sent a pound to the guy at the top of the list, and cross his name off and add your own name to the bottom. Pass the list to 20 other people. The list was only 3 names long, so in theory after a week or so you start receiving 1 pound from random people  until you have £8000. That was a lot of money to me then!

But then so was a pound. 

But I'm not stupid. I crossed the top name off, added my own name and sent the letter to 20 friends. Top guy would still receive £7999 so I doubt he's GaF about mine.

And nothing came in the post for me. Not a single person sent me a pound.

But I did some math all the same.

3 generations is 8000
4 generations is 160000
5 generations is 3200000
6 generations is 64,000,000 people (UK population).

7 generations is 1.2B people.
8 Generations is 24 BILLION people. More than the entire early population, and the letter has only gone through the list 8 times.

I wonder how many of those 24Billion theoretical people actually received anything at all!"
"I like to think that I'd have not fallen for one of these pitches and I am probably right, but back when I was 18 I hadn't ever heard of MLMs. I guess I'd have backed out of it even so because I am damn shit at selling things even when they're legitimate!  I always think if someone wants to buy something, they just go and get it? I'd never try to convince someone to buy something they didn't want."
"Eventually is waaaay sooner then people think. You would have the entire world in under 15 cycles if you start from the founder, which you aren't. So lets assume you start early, lets say you're the 50th person to get into it. You run out of people within 12 cycles.   
1. 1>5

"When I was in my mid 20s a really good friend of mine came to me with an opportunity. He was  very serious so I listened.  
He offered to partner up to pay 10k to join a program where we could make tons of money. I had no idea what a pyramid scheme was back then, but when he explained to me that ""all we had to do"" after paying up was to find at least 4 other people willing to join, I was just flabbergasted. How can we make money without creating anything of value ? Why should we pay 10k in the first place and not go straight to finding 40k ?  
20 years later we're still friends but I never asked him if he went through."

I got roped into a discount travel one (WorldVentures, now known as DreamTrips International), and then another floormate of mine this for these energy drinks (can't remember the name off hand)"
Was it Monavie?
"I got further than you, but the second I heard ""you need to buy XXX amount"" after the second meeting I was like ""yo I eat my roommate's leftovers and haven't changed my pants in 3 weeks. I need to make money not spend money."" it unraveled for me."
"I had an ex who one night was telling me all about this ""business opportunity"" he was presented by someone he knew, and he's regurgitating all the buzzwords and phrases and I keep asking him how exactly it makes money and he finally got to the point about recruiting people. I looked at him and said ""....so a pyramid scheme"". He got so mad at me and tried to counter and prove it wasn't but I just kept repeating pyramid scheme. He eventually saw it and then he was mad how quick I saw it and he didn't. "
Your bf: no it's not a pyramid scheme!!! (Then continues to explain why it actually is) lol
"I had a college friend get sucked into a knife selling one the summer between freshman and sophomore year. My fam felt bad for him so we had him over for a demo.

Poor guy tried to demo by slicing a tomato, which he struggled with, seriously squishing the thing, and suggested my fam compare with one of our knives. Obviously doing exactly what he'd been suggested by the person who recruited him. My dad is *fanatical* about knives and will spend ages honing them (even if he didn't forge them himself, which he did sometimes too). My dad sliced the tomato super easy into ridiculously thin slices. My friend looked like he was about to die of embarrassment...

By the time school resumed in the fall he wasn't doing it anymore, that's for sure."
"Some girl in our friend group got roped into the knife one. While doing her ""demo"", she was *really* struggling to cut a chunk of leather with the ""fancy"" knife. My boyfriend at the time pulled out his hunting knife and asked to try. She gave him some ""they must have given me the wrong kind of leather by mistake, it's extra thick"" excuse, but let him try. It sliced through the leather like a hot knife through room temperature butter."
"But how?

That's just incompetence then, even the cheapest garbage knives can be sharp when new, they'll just dull way quicker than a good one but you wouldn't show that in a demonstration"
"Yup. The ""business"" obviously wasn't setting their people up with already sharpened knives, sharpening tools, or even reasonable instructions... and this kid was naive enough to assume that the person above him actually knew what they were doing."
"One year was working at Syracuse NY fair across from guy working pitch booth selling those ginsu knives. If you watched closely, at the end of the pitch, when he dulled the knife by sawing on wood with it and cutting aluminum, he'd put it back in its box, set it aside, talk some more to distract the crowd, and then the abused knife in box would be the one handed to one of the first customers as their newly purchased knife."
Sounds like Amway!
Sure does!
This is exactly what I don't get! All those products are available at stores and people already have a system for buying them. Are they really going to decouple a chunk of their grocery shopping to buy from someone they've never heard of? It's not like anyone is struggling to find toothpaste.
"I almost got roped into one before I knew what a pyramid scheme was. I was studying business at age 18, and they tried to convince me to skip my business classes to attend their *secret seminar* which would *totally make me way more money than college does*. This was after roping me into reading the network marketing book. They make you feel like you've invested too much energy to quit, and also you have passed their test and been preselected!!

I bussed clear across town to meet these goons because they wanted to meet in their (or their mentors') radius.

When I found out what a pyramid scheme was in business class, I brought it up and this guy sketched it for me on a napkin, showing that his totally-not-an-MLM was in fact blob shaped, and you made more money by creating more connections in this blob shape. Like bro, that's just a pyramid in disguise."
"This is the big challenge in selling most MLM products. There are rare exceptions, but generally they're not any better than most competing products people are already using except because they don't have excess layers of middlemen they are generally far cheaper."
"Imo they are *never* as good or even nearly as good as competing products


Like if this knife is as good as or better than the leading brands *why* is a 19 year old teenage mum from a small town in west Virginia selling them **surely** supermarkets would want to stock this amazing knife?

It's like the juice plus shit that was floating about years ago . The amount of lies and bullshit youd hear about that 

I remember being on Facebook and my cousin announced her baby passed away from SIDS and some bitch literally went ""my sympathies I can't imagine how you feel *but* to those who are worried Juice plus multivitamins are safe for babies and actually stop SIDS from occuring""

Like  ""You know that condition that doctors can't test for, don't know the cause of it and the baby is likely born with whatever makes it occur? If you had bought my unregulated unproven bullshit pyramid scheme berries your kid would be still alive now...""

She rightly got the shit kicked out of her by someone  at the wake after she turned up uninvited (it was an open funeral where all were allowed to attend should they choose but obviously my cousin blocked her after that comment so idk why she thought this open invite applied to her.) and started trying to sell that shit to anyone who had had a few drinks in them."
"Amway? I was invited to a “get together” by a friend and her husband, ended up several of us sitting through an Amway recruitment session"
"I knew a guy who fell for something like this. His explanation was something like you can just use the products yourself and save money compared to store brands and then get other people to join and you get a cut from their investment. 

Then I met him again 5 years later and somehow he had no recollection of any of it."
"Amway?

I met a guy one time, for 10 minutes, during a flood at my apartment complex. We didn't exchange info. The next week I moved. A week after that, I started to get calls on my answering machine every week from some guy whose name I didn't recognize. Always called during the day, M-F. He never left any details, other than his name and number. I never called him back. This went on for **one year**. Finally, I was home sick one day when he called. I was salty. I was like, who the hell are you!? Why have you been calling me!? He reminded me how we had met. I was legit creeped out how he could have got my info. He then went into a soft Amway pitch and wanted to meet for coffee to go into more detail. I burst into laughter. A solid year. That's either committed or a cult."
Amway?
"Oh god, Amway."
"When I worked in retail those people would literally corner me at work and when I said no they would get hostile and say things like, “I guess you don’t like money!”"
One of my older sisters fell for that where she wouldn't post the names of those products.  I knew that she was part of the MLM just by her posts and pics. Didn't warn her about it because we weren't on good speaking terms.  Idk if she's still doing that. 🤷🏻‍♀️
"Especially if you are a woman, it could have been an actual promoting job. Then again, with ""set my own hours and recruit other people"", probably not."
I knew a guy in college who was involved in an MLM for some vitamin juice. He had a full crate of this stuff and claimed he was gonna sell it no problem and then keep selling it until he was rich. He never sold a single bottle and people started getting annoyed with him constantly trying to sell it to them.
"Ye, I got roped into a Hover vacuum's recruitment session. The guy spent about 1min talking about it being sales, then did his sales pitch for the vacume, kinda sold me on it being a good product. Then we took a break, he tried to talk to me and one other person... guess we paid the most attention or whatever. So, me and her end up out in the parking lot ""smoking""... but not smoking. We both agreed to it being shady and way over priced went to lunch together, and then never talked again"
"Hey, Amway made a lot of people very rich. But you need a warm market. You need to be liked and respected and charismatic. You need to be a good salesperson. I was none of those. It wasn't Amway but I tried it and I failed. What a f****** waste of time."
"Similar story: 1998 and I was a 20yo walking around the Houston Auto Show. Approached by some rando while looking at the cars.

Anyway, two weeks later I’m in a packed ballroom at the West Loop Marriott in Houston’s Galleria neighborhood attending an (drumroll please) Amway presentation. Ohhhhh I was pissed.

Thankfully, even at 20, I knew Amway was a scam and declined."
One terrible job I had right out of college (yes it was hard back then to get a job right out of college just like now) the sales manager had like 30 burner phones and would answer each one with a different name. It was some sort of Oracle consultant scam or something. I only lasted a couple days before I noped out.
Sent my sis the bit by John Oliver and the big herbalife doc. She says her product isn't an mlm. Literally same situation.
"I saw a segment of Shark Tank once where some dude tried to sell them on an a MLM scheme. 

All of them were like... the fuck is wrong with you? Do you think we'd actually fall for this bullshit? (The worst part was, this dude genuinely seemed to think it was a legit business.)"
Please tell me which season and episode this is. I'd love to watch that.
"It was actually dragons den (unless there was a different occasion) and its should be Season 6 Episode 9, no im not joking, the company was lyoness if I’m not mistaken"
So not even inventing their own new MLM?
Well if people signed up he would make money
It's a reverse funnel system!
But where do I put my feet?
Where does he put his feet
"Dee, his feet?"
I think the more important question is why is Frank in that coil?
Is it a sex thing?
"I love how they leave him in there in his underwear and he just keeps yelling while children are playing all around him like it’s not weird at all- tbf this may be a normal thing for a Philly playground, does anyone know? 😂"
Invigaron!
"Less talking, more golf clubs please"
"See, people like us, we don't get got...we go get!"
Where am I supposed to put my feet?
Your feet? It doesn't matter.
The machine says 157. That's 157 *what*?
...units!
Units of what?
Units of stress!
"Oh my god, that's so many units!"
What is it with the goddamn feet?!
Dee? His feet?
Anywhere in frame.
I'm here for the free soup.
It all starts with the berries!
"We don't get got, we go git"
"It’s not a pyramid scheme, it’s a trapezoid"
you won't get got
Its a three dimensional triangle strategy
We're in a dimaryp!
A triangle of opportunities!
the berries
"A DIMARYP?

(I don't know if you can look it up but one guy was selling his pyramid scheme as something that was the opposite of a pyramid scheme and he actually called it that and started shouting that word."
"I remember a time when you would here people say, ""It's not a pyramid scheme, it's multi-level marketing."""
"I just saw a conversation on FB today where someone was arguing that, lol. Oh, okay, boo, you're right- you're a girl boss. Yay, you. 🙄"
Turn the funnel upside down.
it's sad because it targets women who want to be their own entrepeneurs
That's exactly what I did when my sister asked me what I thought about some MLM shit someone tried to talk her into. I told her to run a mile and sent her a link to the John Oliver episode. It worked.
"Yeah, you have to get them before they get hooked, after that it's too embarrassing to admit that they got duped"
Link?
[Here you go](https://youtu.be/s6MwGeOm8iI?si=_A4hHaOMHg2SOIDO)
Thank you!!!
"It’s not multi-level marketing, it’s network marketing which is different /s"
Or “direct selling”
You cut out the middleman and get scammed yourself instead of the customer!
Social selling lol
I just need 5 ladies to share this post on Facebook and Ill give you a 10% discount!! #bossbabe
"James Jani has a great video on [MLM](https://youtu.be/He1bgJ0sqtw?si=A6V0wQxc8je5qHTq) as well, highly recommend."
Penn and Teller told me all i needed to learn when i was 17. i think they put those meat selling shitheads out of business.
"My cousin is convinced he's an ""entrepreneur"" because he does ""network marketing."" He even put ""entrepreneur"" in his Facebook profile. He sells massively overpriced CBD supplements for Hempworx."
"I have a girl I went to HS with who has done probably 5 different “network marketing” companies - and every time she switches she gets on and talks about how 6
Months ago she wasn’t making the money she is now etc etc. but 6 months ago she was bragging about how much money she makes being able to work from home and stay with her babies… make it make sense"
"Do they think all their friends are too stupid to know they're just copying and pasting whatever the company told them to copy and paste? They give over their entire social media feeds to whatever MLM they're currently in, and it's the greatest thing in the whole world, and then six months later, some other identical company that happens to sell something different is the greatest thing in the whole world."
yes I have heard that statement from my mother
It’s all about the spin
"One issue I’ve seen is that there are some legitimate brands that make good products but still do this stupid MLM setup. 

My kids favorite books are from a company called Usborne. They make some really cute books but they do the whole “buy from a consultant model” and they are happy to give you information on how to sell it your self. 

Cutco is another example. The knives are decent from what I’m told (they even sell them at Costco) but I was heavily pressured to become a consultant by another friend I knew in college. 

If you remember the P90X workout program that was popular in the early 2010s it also was sold by an MLM. 

In none of those instances would I call the products bad or scams but the business model absolutely is."
"> In none of those instances would I call the products bad or scams but the business model absolutely is.

Makes one wonder if they ran the numbers and determined that the product would flop (lack of advertising/word of mouth) without this level of forced marketing."
"Cutco knives fucking rule. The model doesn't.

Back when my brother was in high school a few of his friend's ended up working for Cutco. My mom brought a few steak knife steaks from a few of them to give as wedding favors. Helped some of them reach their goals. Helped my mom not have to think about future wedding gifts for nieces and nephews. Not a bad win/win scenario."
“How can it be a pyramid scheme when the item I’m selling is shaped like a box?”
They are trained to basically deflect such evidence despite the fact that their own website has accurate data of how much most people… DO NOT MAKE!
This is 100% it. They know MLMs are bad. They just know THEIR company isn't one. How these people can gaslight themselves I'll never know.
As someone who from time to time drinks herbalife. I can tell you that now they are making it sneakier to sell that stuff under different disguises such as trying to get in the “Starbucks/boba tea” trends. They would never say it’s herbalife and avoid at all costs. One main reason they are doing this because the product is so over price and a lot of long time customers starting finding dupes for it .
She start yelling DIMARYP too?
"Wow that was one hell of a watch. 

For the lazy…it’s not a DIMARYP, it’s a *_PYRAMID_*!

https://youtu.be/s6MwGeOm8iI?si=6DWlbNCpoGtNbBlQ"
my mother is stuck in that nonsense as well
Young living essential oils is similar to this lol
"I did this with a friend, and she gave the exact same answer."
I have a 107 stress level
"The biggest scam people still fall for is they watch ""John Oliver videos"""
Peggy and Bill found out about MLMs themselves. And taught us along the way
Twice! She literally faked her death to escape cozy kitchen.
"While it wasn't quite an MLM let's not forget that Mrs Smartypants also fell for the ""Intelligence Institute of Texas"" which was just another scam."
*Doctor* Smartypants
“I have too many good anuses ahead of me to spend my life in a cigar factory.”
"They had motorboats, Peggy.  MOTORBOATS!"
"""We're going to nationals."" A different MLM in fact. Metalized.

Edit: You were talking about Metalife. The guy downthread brought up Cozy Kitchen."
It’s a reverse funnel system
Where do I put my feet?
Are you stuck in a coil by chance?
"It's not a scheme, hun. They're small business owners!

(/s)

Edit to add:  r/antiMLM"
They’re boss babes
"And a mompreneur.

And a She-E-O."
"I do find all of this so amusing but it does still infuriate that this is what the companies rely on as their targets. (Usually young) women, either single Mums or those who don't have their own income and perhaps would struggle to due to childcare/disability/vulnerability/never having had a job- other issues-and they find themselves in a much worse position than before. It's maddening that MLMs exploit this vulnerability of these people."
Don't forget the nail polish emoji
#girlboss
I love the ones that post that they just got promoted to some bullshit title
"love that subreddit!!

I despise the holiday season when these ""boss babes"" are all over the craft shows and FB wanting you to ""support small businesses"".

No thanks, I'll buy these cute personalized growth rulers from this mom that she makes and paints, rather than your overpriced Usborne books or scentsy candles."
Hey girly!  I know it's been a few years...  how's life?  We need to catch up!  Let's meet for coffee!  xoxo!
"With brand new, beautiful cars, a beautiful house with a swimming pool. Be your own boss! They have brochures they give you with those pics on it to try and suck you in. This is what you could have!"
"I was out with my mother once and some dude starting chatting with us. We asked him what he did and he replied that he was an ""international business consultant."" 

So I asked, ""Oh is that something like Amway?""

He was instantly deflated and went away."
I just saw the friend of a friend is an MD also pushing this crap. Is the doctor money not enough?!
I have literally heard of a marketing professor promoting an MLM in their class. Some people are just greedy or plain stupid. I feel worse for people that are desperate and spend their last dollar on the MLM products that the MLM promises they will profit off of.
Greedy is definitely the motivator. Her house is enormous!
Pyramid schemes work as long as they are growing.  Marketing is a scummy line of work so they definitely knew and wanted to market themselves a big ass pyramid.
"Ita so silly when you go just past the surface of their lies. ""We cut out the middle man of putting our items in stores or paying for advertising so we can pay you directly!""


Really, Sally? Is it better for the company to sell decent goods at a reasonable price and just pay for minimal Amazon warehousing and facebook/google CPMs or pay for an army of inexperienced ""salespeople"" to try and get rid of their overpriced inventory only to realize all the easy money is in selling hopes and dreams instead of the product."
"I think some people understand the scam, but they have such a huge ego, that the actually think they'll be the one who succeeds."
"Happened to me. My business marketing Prof referred me to this insurance company. Sounded like a great opportunity for jump starting my career after university. Sure there was a legitimate insurance company, but the sales force was mlm structured with regional vice presidents and looking for recruits when you're selling. The insurance sales side of it was also manipulative and scammy. AND the targets were all retired school teachers. I just couldn't. I even moved halfway across the country for it. I felt scammed and trapped"
Monat? Either we know the same woman or it’s a thing.
No a different one.
Seeing a doctor sell that crap would be an automatic appointment cancellation for me.
Same. It's very exploitative.
It's funny because it works for them due to position and status. You can huck a lot of fixes and pills as a doctor.
It's extremely unethical.
"I told this story in a different sub a few weeks ago....

Before everyone he had a cell phone with free long distance, long distance phone plans were a competitive business and made it into MLM.

I went to the dentist and while the tech was doing my cleaning she asks, ""So are the you happy with your long distance plan?"""
"I do believe I may have been involved with that, if it was in the 90s. (around 97/98) 

My father's business partner sold him on some Long Distance MLM scheme and then he paid all the fees to get me involved with it. Total scam. They charged _more_ than all the competition and we were supposed to guilt trip people into paying more to help us out. Like, we were supposed to _really_ lay on the guilt trip tactics. (""So you'd rather let me fail than pay a few cents more per minute than you do now?"" To which my mother said, ""Yes, absolutely. You're trying to sell me an inferior product. You _should_ fail."")

I never made a single sale to anyone (despite asking every single person I knew) and, had I spent anything on it, I would have lost money. I did not make a single cent."
"I had a coworker who got a call from her son’s doctor shortly after her son was in for a checkup. The doctor wanted to stop by their house one evening soon. They said sure, thinking the labs showed the worst result imaginable. Turns out the worst was a MLM scheme. Seriously!"
Once you take away the student loan payments and the malpractice insurance there probably isn’t much left
Student loans
"In high school we did a project where we had to research an MLM basically to learn about how scammy they were. By the end of it, the dumb girl in the class (for lack of better words) ended up joining the MLM she researched. Such a slap-to-the-forehead moment."
Please post this story in r/antimlm 🤦🏻‍♀️
This is probably one of the most craziest stories I’ve read on here😹
I live in a gated community where I swear half the Moms here sell Arbonne. I’ve been asked so many times to join. Hard stop. NO! I will say though my one friend is one of the “top” sellers and did get the free Mercedes and all the trips and makes $250k a year… but she has to hustle and it has taken her 10 years.
She probably had to fuck over hundreds of SAHMs too
And by “top” sells you mean top scammers lol
[deleted]
"When I was looking for a job, my sister-in-law tried to pull me into a pyramid scheme for I think Arbonne too. She framed it as something related to my field and even said the name of the company was whatever her “team’s” name was so I wouldn’t catch on right away. 

But she wouldn’t answer questions straight, and her responses sounded like they were out of some guidebook. My guard was down at first because it was my sister-in-law… but after some back and forth I figured it out and told her absolutely not and she should be careful with this scheme. 

She never brought it up again and for whatever reason doesn’t sell for them anymore. But I will never forget that when I was vulnerable and in need of a job, she tried to exploit me for money."
Arbonne and Monat!
They do a very good face scrub. I have a friend who was selling that and the way they make money is by getting other people to sell it under them and so on. so you’re constantly having to try to talk other people into investing in the company. once you get one set of employees underneath you and they start getting their employees. The idea is that you make money and never have to sell another product. She hasn’t gotten there yet. It’s been four years.
"The thing they don't tell you about the Mercedes is that it's a lease, and they pay the lease, as long as you meet your goals. If you ever fail to meet the goals, oops, you're on the hook for those Mercedes payments."
Hahaha I didn’t know that. She doesn’t have the Mercedes anymore and I did hear through the grapevine she wasn’t making as much as recent years lol.
"Yup, just another method to control them. Once they're stuck with that lease, they'll do anything to keep those payments coming, including buying extra product themselves under the illusion that they'll somehow sell it. Whenever you see one of thesw idiots on Facebook offering discounts on stuff, more likely than but they bought extra product to preserve their level/tier."
People near me sell Cabi clothes. No.
My sister did that a while back. I never bought anything from her
"But this one's totally different......

Said every MLM agent ever."
The issue is those same people double down and reject any information you give them.They just won't let themselves realize they're being scammed.
"It proves the saying 

""Life is hard; it's harder when you are stupid.""

I have heard of people losing money that could not afford on these schemes."
Desperation and stupidity are a dangerous combination
"Beyond the financial damage the MLMs also destroy relationships. Victims, desperate for sales and downstreams, start harassing their friends and families.


My wife and I have been pleasantly surprised to hear from old friends that we haven't heard from in a while, then it turns out to be a sales pitch."
Have you seen the documentary LuLaRich? It's really good. MLMs are awful
"The TV series *On Becoming a God in Central Florida* may be a dark comedy, but it does a fabulous job of showing what is motivating people to get sucked into pyramid schemes. I think we have been brainwashed by the idea that we all should aspire to own our own businesses, and MLM schemes look like a sure-fire way to do that. (Also a lot of people try to buy franchises, which don’t always work out either.) A couple of generations ago you could easily get a job with decent pay and benefits, but those days are long gone."
Yeah I think lularoe helped expose every other mlm (minus Tupperware because I still love it and you can buy from the site lol) .
I love the response of “it’s not a pyramid scheme. Those are illegal.” Well smoking is legal and it still kills people. Being legal doesn’t make it right. You just found a workaround.
">  We have literally so much information now about how they are predatory.

I think the thing we've learned is; access to information isn't the issue. People choose to believe the things that comfort them and ignore reality."
"exactly! targeting moms with promises of ‘financial freedom’ and ‘being your own boss.’ They’re just preying on vulnerability, and it’s infuriating"
"They're cults that promise prosperity. Once you're in to a certain level it's too painful to admit you were duped. 

I've confronted friends only to find out they'd been a part of something for years and they defended it so rabidly that they'd rather stay with it and end the friendship."
Like Trumpism and the Prosperity preachers capturing the ‘temporarily embarrassed millionaires’.
"Another thing we can thank the Reagan legacy for 

He kneecapped the FTC’s ability to shut them down"
"A few years back I was renting a room from a couple who had a teenage daughter.  She graduated from high school shortly after I moved in and was looking for a part-time job.  One day she comes in all excited about a possible job offer she got in the mail.  That alone made me suspicious, so I asked to see what she'd gotten.  She showed me the letter and I started poring over it, lots of promises of flexible hours to work around school schedules and extra money to put towards college, but very little actual info...until finally, near the bottom, I saw it: Vector Marketing.

*It was fucking Cutco Knives.*

I immediately told her to avoid that ""job offer"" and any others like it."
This. I remember the rodan and fields reps popping up in my area and it was sad seeing them work so hard just to make the founders richer
"The newest form of this is in the thousands of Instagram/Social Media ""COACHES"". All with some different wording of ""I quit my 9-5, now I make $XX,XXX a month doing X, comment X to get a dm and learn how"". Every time sure enough the comments will be full of people commenting to learn more. I don't doubt that the person posting it actually does make that amount of money, I'm sure they do, they're at the top of the pyramid. And nothing but a bunch of suckers below"
"I know a guy from school whose wife claims to make $20k/month consistently, and it's all she posts about on Facebook. Getting other women involved in her ""high ticket sales coaching"" business. I have absolutely no clue what they actually do because there's no available information on it."
So many advertise on YouTube as well. Surely these platforms have some duty of care with this crap.
"They're all over Tiktok live. Bomb Party sells ""mystery"" jewelry and there are thousands of reps selling live.  I've reported the reps that are actively recruiting since it's against Tiktok's term and conditions but Tiktok always replies that there was no violation."
My mom loves them and just refuses to believe any MLM she gets involved with counts as an MLM
"Even things that aren't considered MLM's but definitely fit under the pyramid scheme along with MLM's. My favorite is the book exchange that comes along every Christmas that I try to warn people away from by letting them know it's a pyramid scheme and is illegal.

Last year I had someone argue that it wasn't a pyramid scheme and it was ""just for fun"" and I didn't have to participate. I mean, I definitely won't, but if people at the top get all the books and the people at the bottom get zero, that's super scammy and super scummy.

If any one pyramid scheme/MLM worked the way it's set up to work and each of your four friends recruit their four friends and so on (or however many, I don't have the exact info readily available), you only get to 13 levels before you exceed the population of the entire world."
The irony is that you have a better chance to succeed in the illegal pyramid scheme.
"I have a cousin that bounces from MLM to MLM every couple years theres a new one. It drove me nuts that i unfriended her. Like i thought they were so successful, why would you try a diff one? 🤔"
Had a roommate Down on his luck bring some mlm recruiters to the house once. I was just getting some grub from the kitchen and after he introduced them to me they began the spiel. I politely said I was t interested and they commented  that I probably want to work the rest of my life. I just smiled got my grub and went back to my room. Vultures.
"Beat me to it. I'm revisiting the Chris Watts murders, and the MLM is like a character all its own that drove everyone to the brink of utter insanity. They are evil and they tear families apart."
"Yes! 1 million times, YES! And if you try to explain it to someone, it's almost like they've been brainwashed that ""mine doesn't work like that!"" I'm in a small town with lots of women who prey on stay at home moms with these schemes. Not one of them will admit it's MLM."
Oh my  God I was applying for job on indeed. Got 20 minutes into the call hung up it was a travel mlm.
utah has entered the chat! LOL
"I feel bad but I definitely used highschool acquaintances that got sucked into MLMs for free lunches in college. Some of them try to get you in with a 1:1 meeting over coffee or food and usually will offer to pay in order to sell the illusion that it's a money maker. 

Just tune out their spiel and enjoy your meal!"
This right here is the answer.
"The interesting thing is some of them make legitimately good products, but the whole MLM scam makes people not want them. My neighbor is an older lady who works as an assistant at a big university's law school. She makes all her salary that way. She knows people her age that were huge into Amway and she technically ""joined"" but all she does is buy products for herself and as gifts. I've received plenty of good personal care products (shaving cream, etc) that were awesome, as gifts from her. She knows MLM's are stupid, but if you can get the products for yourself ""wholesale"" why not I guess?

Similarly my mom bought a Cutco slotted spoon in the mid 90's from our babsitter's boyfriend who was roped into their sales stuff. I guess it's technically an MLM? (aka Vector Marketing). Was an awesome slotted spoon and she still has it 30 years later. Good product, crappy sales tactics."
My wife was interested in joining one. Her sisters do it and peer pressure is high obviously. I said no probably a dozen times and did my best to educate her but I finally let her try. She didn’t even last the training session because of how scummy it sounded
"I know someone who thinks MLMs are the greatest money making scheme there is.

They've been through several of them and spent thousands only to get nothing and fail. every time. Yet they keep doing them, saying they're _doing it right_ this time and going to become a millionaire. (They 100% blame themselves for all the failures, saying it's their fault.)

It's like... you've done probably half a dozen MLMs so far and every single one has failed and lost you _thousands_ per attempt. Why the fuck do you keep doing this?!"
"I was invited to an MLM event by a former coworker (he just said to come to his place for a bbq), and had to sit there and listen to someone talk about their health supplement MLM company for an hour. I stayed, cos bbq. I actually found it quite an interesting experience because some of the techniques used appear lifted straight from the televangelist playbook (or maybe it’s the other way round, who knows who copied who). It was exceedingly predatory behaviour. It really felt like a cult group without the religious trappings.

I said “this is very interesting but I’d like some evidence for your claims. Like actual peer reviewed evidence please”. They promised they’d get back to me with all this evidence they had. They never did."
"What's worse is that they made a law against pyramid schemes, but apparently renaming the scam is enough to get around the law."
"Lost one of my best friends to one of these. In her wedding and everything. Kept in touch after college. I knew she was doing MLM stuff, but she never bugged me about it until one day... she asked me (m) about my skincare routine. I told her I didn't have one, and I wasn't interested, so please stop there. She texted me every couple hours about her product for the next week, until I blocked her number and socials. Tried talking to her about it about a year later, and her response text was to ask me if I was ready to change my mind about her product. That shit consumes people. "
"This. It's despicable how they prey on people - I have a friend who's $14k into debt in one (the water one), she's a single mom and has full belief she'll see a return on the money she spent. It's absolutely a scam and I have to remain quiet about it because I value our friendship. But I was dismayed to learn she'd taken out *loans* for it."
"I'm a debt specialist and unfortunately I've been seeing people like her asking for help after they've accumulated so much debt that they can no longer even make the minimums anymore. It's really sad to see. 

What is even worse is that I can't even help some of these people, and bankruptcy ends up being their only option. The reason being is that they end up sinking SO much into these scams that their debt to income ratio is far too high to be approved for any loans, THEN they go to these disgusting predatory loan companies with 1000%+ interest(yes you read that right, 1000%). For example, I saw one last week that the guy borrowed $1,200(ironically to pay off another predatory loan lol) and it was 25 WEEKLY payments. At the end he'd have paid almost $36k. Doesn't sound legal, but there are loopholes that allow them. 

The reason we can't help is because these predatory loan companies will make the loan term less than the federal minimum allowed to enter into any consolidation programs. So their only route is to go the bankruptcy route. Most of them won't even qualify for chapter 7 either due to their spouse making too much. It's sad. So many starting these with credit cards and will never, never make a profit."
"I almost fell for one last week. They were tricky. It was a real office building, with real people making real money, working six days a week, for over twelve hours a day, calling themselves sales, with a large “pump up” meeting every morning, everyone had worked there for 2 days to 4 weeks aside from the five core team members presenting at the meetings, and we were fed lunch every day. I get excited during interviews and tend to not ask questions so halfway through training I realized I wasn’t getting paid and left without intention of coming back. 

The mlm was in how they were hiring “team members” so that the “team leaders” could get promoted. One of the most successful guys there was talking about how you find someone who hates their job and recruit them underneath you.

(Also, I am super into early sobriety and could tell this is the kind of environment that would cause me to relapse immediately.)"
[deleted]
Huh. Learn something new every day.
"Oh gosh, I fell into that trap come freshman year of college

I remember someone came from this one called WorldVentures (relaunched in recent years as DreamTrips)

When I found out about how said membership cost, my eyes went wide and I immediately called WV up to get out of it because I wasn't about that

Heck, even when I texted some of my friends about it to try to get them to sign up, one of them even caught on and could smell a scam"
"When I turned 18 (still in high school mind you) I had a former teacher who I really respected message me happy birthday and try to recruit me into her mlm and wouldn't take no for an answer, so I had to block her. It was incredibly sad, and I lost all respect for her. And on my birthday!"
"its kinda of an "" idiot test"" for people you know. if someone I know tries to sell me and MLM product or I see they sell it. I know how easy they can be scammed and there for an idiot"
"My mom had a good friend whose daughter got into Herbalife at the bottom and rose in the ranks to live very lavishly. She became one of the top people on the pyramid. However, she was never the sharpest tool in the shed, and one time on a flight she told the guy sitting next to her how wealthy she was. He took a great interest in her story and asked her out. Long story short, he was a grifter with multiple ex-wives and numerous children. He failed to share that info with her until after she foolishly married him without a pre nup. After a few years he filed for divorce and she had to part with several million in the settlement. But the story doesn’t end there. He was murdered by one of his ex-wives and my Herbalife connection sued his family to get her money back claiming she and the grifter were never legally married because his previous divorce had never been finalized. Ultimately the judge ruled against her and the last time I saw her she was on the local news  crying outside the courthouse. What an idiot."
LuLularoe!
"Rainbow. Fucking. Garbage. Vacuums. 

Posts all over assnovel (Facebook) but won't say how much the damned things cost. It's ALWAYS pm/dm me for details."
"I have a cousin who worked in pharmaceuticals, and now at a hospital still spewing it, and excited how companies can now intermingle, meaning if she likes the lip gloss from this company she can sell this, and the hair products from this company, and makeup from over here. Signing you’re life away to multiple devils while claiming to be an entrepreneur 🙃"
"For my latinos theres a ""life coaching"" group called ""Top Lider""  and it's 100% a pyramid scheme. They take your cash and give you the most basic advise, the kind of stuff you hear on those cringe tiktoks. A good friend of mine fell for it and right when he joined they asked him and all new members to each ask their family members for $20 but don't tell them what it's for. Turns out they just all used it to have lunch toguether and discuss the next level where they had to pay $300 to learn, the prices went up as the levels increased. They had everyone wear white like a cult and they had him shave his bread which is something he had always swore he would never do. I honestly didn't care until he started to reach out to all his female family members to get them to join, that shit is creepy.

Top Líder is a cult/pirámide scheme"
Shave his bread? Did you mean shave his BEARD? 😭 I’m just imagining him swearing he’ll never cut the crusts off his bread with a razor up and down his whole life and being forced cut off the outsides of his sandwich under duress
"literally my mother with the beauty brand Jafra, not sure if anyone ever heard of it …"
"Also if you're unsure if it's a MLM or not, a quick google search will tell you."
Yes and it's extra annoying when your family invites you to parties to sell stuff to you. And you feel obligated to be there and once you're there you feel obligated to buy something. This is part of the reason why I got off of facebook. So many people adding me to their groups expecting me to buy a bunch of tea or Pampered Chef products or Tupperware or whatever.
"Yeah it really seems rebranding pyramid schemes as mlm was all it took. I remember when King of the Hill had an episode about them, it's just as relevant today as it was when it first aired some 20 years ago if nor moreso"
https://youtu.be/uuVh36vQkSI?si=S2itJYi59sV_54wt
"I didn't even know what MLM was when I was younger, until I seen that KOTH episode about it. I steer clear of those MLM scams because of that episode. lol"
"I sat through FOUR HOURS of Vivint ""interview"" before I sat across a desk from someone who actually asked me about my work experience or resume. 

They asked me why I wanted to work for them, and I honestly responded with ""I really don't anymore, this was a huge waste of time."" & left."
"One time I was invited to an MLM party. It felt so overwhelming since everyone is ""rich"" and they point at one person and whispering you know he bought his first ""branded"" car. 


I didn't pursue that because I was thinking I will burden the people I know to buy the things I'll be selling. And honestly, if I kept on selling to the same people what will be the timing, every month? So I thought with my personality and the math, this won't work for me. So I ghosted them after that."
You just don’t get it… if you get five people and *they* get five people…
"i remember being desperate for a job like 20 years ago and attending some orientation for some sales job and having to sit through like two hours of orientation talking about sales and about these knives we were going to be selling and then at the very end we were all informed we had to buy a set of these expensive knives ourselves to demonstrate to customers 

everybody walked out then"
"my mom spends over 200$ per month on MLMs, she doesnt believe anyone saying theyre a scam, we live paycheck to paycheck because of her"
"Once had a girl friend of mine fall for a mlm scheme, I tried telling her that it was a scam, and  she got more and more angry with me, we went to her car mid discussion, as soon as we got into her car she got angry and said, «ITS NOT A SCAM» before she reversed her big truck straight into another parked car, it was pretty awkward afterwards…"
I have a cousin whose in Amway and he says its not bad because he and the others associated with his mentor make more money than he does and that its networking 🤷‍♀️
"I know a couple that lost their legitimate business to living the Herbal Life.  Did they learn?  No, they decided it was the product that was the problem and went all in on LulaRoe, Jamberry, and Sensy.  They are still financially struggling.  I even posted the John Olive clip to my facebook page and edited my privacy settings so it was only visible to the two of them.  They ignored it as not applying to their particular situation and again reiterated that success is based on a ""product by product basis""."
"Penn and Teller, when they had their show, Bullsh/t! Did an episode on mlm. People are better off working minimum wage jobs than participating in mlms"
Betsy Devos of Amway money is literally using money from poor folks to defund education.  Gross on two levels.
Moms Losing Money
People know it's a scam but they think they're smart enough that they'll be at the top of the pyramid
"When I finished my MBA program had a friend of my sister in law approach me at my nieces birthday party to ask talk to him about a business opportunity. 

We set up a time for a call a week later as I assumed he was starting a real business and wanted advice, but he immediately started pitching me on his MLM which as Amway is disguise. At first he denied it was an MLM or Amway until I sent him the links that show the two companies are the same.

Hung up and never spoke to him again."
"Some of those have been running for so long, my mom and  grandmother both have stories about being invited to what they thought was a 'welcome to the neighborhood ' parties, only for is to be mlm pitches. I think Tupperware, and one of the cleaning ones. 

Now for me it's changed to 'old friend on Facebook who you think wants to catch up'-nope it's just a Scentsy pitch."
"They have gotten a lot better at conditioning the victims in these. An acquittance got suckered in and it was interesting to observe the whole thing in a sad, train wreck kind of a way. Apparently the very first thing they did was to sell her the idea that everyone around her giving negative feedback was extremely envious of her impending riches and needed to be 'dealt with'. She became extremely defensive to any advice that the artisan soap she was supposed to start selling wasn't going to be a huge sales success and the mandatory, paid classes she had to take and the noticeable inventory purchases were just going to be left rotting in her home. She tried to run the business as the kind where she's personally dependent on the business' loans and to the shock to no one, completely ruined her personal economy. Naturally before this she also ruined her social life with the whole 'you don't need to find customers, your friends will be the first customers' thinking."
"My mom fell victim to this in the 1980s, so these have been around a very long time. I remember Amway and Avon. She had at least $10,000 of inventory at our house when I cleaned it out last year  (alzheimer's). Probably double or triple that but I can't bring myself to say it. Single mom of 2 kids doing her best."
One of the biggest states for MLMs is Utah...
"Shortly after I got married, my husband and I were eating lunch at a Cafe on Mother's day (we didn't have any kids yet) and a woman was going table to table giving each female diner a pretty wooden flower and saying we could put our names into a raffle to win a makeover/pampering type thing. I thought that sounded nice so I filled out my info. A day or so later I got a call that I had won and could bring one guest. I chose to take my sister with me.


We arrived at the location and it was a *Mary Kay event*. And I started to recognize faces from the cafe; I think every woman was told she ""won"". They tricked us all into going to this sample party. We all got to test products then a form was passed around to order things and separately to sign up to sell MK products. We left and I apologized to my sister but all we could do was laugh about how ridiculous it is. In hindsight it doesn't even feel real."
"I often forget how big of a scam they are because I live in Utah, which the FBI has identified as the MLM affinity fraud capital of the country."
"A friend of mine tried to get me involved in one way back when I was in college.  He convince me to let the guy who got him give me his pitch.  The entire time he was talking about the money I could make from the people ""below me."" When I asked what they sell he said something to the effect of ""we sell everything from cars to toilet paper but it doesn't matter what we sell."" That's when I knew I wasn't going to join up.  I let him finish his pitch and got out as quickly as possible."
I also read an article about how women with high degrees - Masters and doctorates - who choose to become mothers and choose to stay home feel unproductive and get sucked into MLMs because they feel like it’s something they can do to contribute. I know it applies to a friend of mine who got her doctorate.
You should go watch the show “On Becoming a God in Central Florida” on Apple TV or prime. It’s hilarious and it shows how they pull people in.
"I had a sad/weird experience with an MLM pitch. I had just moved into a new home post divorce and didn't know anyone in the area. This lovely woman came over with two boys were similar ages as my boys to deliver a warm banana nut bread to welcome us to the neighborhood and introduce the kids. My sons were at their Dads so we just chit chatted while her sons enjoyed my kids' playroom. I thought I had just met a friend with kids and was so happy! Things were looking up! My kids come home and are very upset that every one of their lego sets were dismantled in their playroom. Totally my fault there - I was enjoying my new friend's company so much neither of us were closely watching the kids. 

Flash forward to a few weeks later she comes by to have the kids play and my kids are a little weirded out by the Lego destroyers coming over but they all go to the playroom to play anyway. Me and 'new friend' start chatting and she starts a damn MLM schpeal. I'm like NOPE almost immediately but her schpeal included her ability to WATCH OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS for $$ while she also works her MLM. So this B is in my house with RANDOM KIDS trying to get me to join her downline. It hit me harder than it probably should because I was in such a vulnerable time period post-divorce. I wanted to kill her with my bare hands. And I couldn't help but think about these kids' parents who couldn't possibly have known that their kids were in random homes being used as pawns to gain entry so their babysitter could promote an MLM !!"
I lost so many friends telling them they're stupid as fuck doing vemma. They had multiple meetings i attended all of them and begged them not to do it trying to explain to them what a pyramid scheme is. They all lost a bunch of money. They apologized and now come to me when it comes to investing. Lmao.
"I went to a couple ""interviews"" for some MLM's when I was like 20-23...thisbwas circa 2007-2010 when mlm's were still a little newer and not as known. I hate those people with a passion."
"Yes! In high school I got sucked into one selling fucking kitchen knives. Idk why I did it. I hate talking to people, I hate phone calls, don't care about cutlery. I made most of my extended family sit with me in their homes and go over a awful, awkward presentation. Also involved my cutting a penny in half with the scissors. Like twice a week after school we had to do group meetings with other reps, all very young. Where we would bust out our phones and they would make us call a set amount of people to get appointments, and if they didn't want to do it we had to see if they had any friends that would be interested.
As an introverted weird girl I lasted 2 weeks .  Maybe. 
OMG. I can't. I think I developed a new PTSD trigger. Fuck you cutco. 
*They do have very nice knives and I still have my demo set decades later.... But. Horrible. Not even sure I got paid properly."
"They're so crazy. It's a commission only sales job, which very few people will enjoy or succeed at. Sales jobs are the ultimate grind, it really takes a certain personality to take constant rejection and keep hitting doors/making calls. There's no overlap there with the kind of people who see MLMs as a way to make bank with little effort.

I know one person who does it and seems to make money, but she's an absolute shark of a salesperson. Her day job is selling UPCs to datacenters for Eaton and she makes bank doing that. No idea why she also hawks the shitty essential oils. I think she's just addicted to sales."
"I once almost got caught in Primerica for a minute. I just graduated from high school, never had a job before and never heard of MLMs or pyramid schemes before so I had no knowledge or warning. This was also in the early days of the Internet before you could just Google everything. Then a friend of mine later roped me into Amway before I left that as well."
"Me too, except it was right after I graduated university.  Something felt off, so I backed out at the last minute which really pissed off the guy who was recruiting me.  Oh well!"
100% this
I got suckered into one and did it for about two months. Oof.
"This. I had a friend who did that. He knew I was looking for a job. He was “I have a job for you” and then proceed to explain exactly that. I was “nah I’m good. I’ll be jobless for now” I forget what company it was, but it was basically Avon but male focused."
MillllloooooMmM
"This is so accurate, my mother got in a mlm a few years ago."
Ahhh a German influencer even made a video about it go viral & had a whole law fight with a specific company (bc he had called them specifically out)
"About 8 years ago, when I first started working at a school (elementary at the time), one of the teachers was pushing Herbalife crap. A bunch of the other ones bought in and became part of her down line, and I would see many pictures of her “team” on Facebook. I always wondered if she (and the others) were idiots, or just insanely malicious."
"The question to always ask yourself, not only with MLMs but with any sales or business proposal is ""Why is this person telling me this, and what's in it for them?""

There are lots of schemes where somebody just wants to ""help"" you make money, whether its investing in real estate, stock advice or whatever else – but if they're sitting on this cool new way of making a profit, what's the sense in sharing it? 

If I'm sitting on this super-undervalued share which I know is going to skyrocket, why the hell would I be telling anybody else about it? I'd be doing all I can do collect and borrow as much capital as I can to buy the share while it's cheap and avoid driving the price up by telling others...unless that's exactly what my goal is. 

There has to be a transparency to any type of transaction. It's not that stock advice is necessarily bad, but what they get out of it has to be obvious – whether it's a set fee as an advisor or a paid subscription. That of course doesn't automatically qualify it as honest, but when somebody is doing you a favor out of the goodness of their hearts, that's a red flag."
"I went to some employment orientation that was just a MLM scheme and felt super uncomfortable about it. I got up to leave and they asked me where I was going, I said ""bathroom"" and was put on the spot about it. I basically was like ""this job isn't for me"" and left for the parking lot immediately."
Because they think they can make money doing minimal work and desperately want it to be true
Unfortunately my uncle made bank being in one and it's legitimized it as a viable money making venture to his siblings. My mum has done a couple including my uncles' one and has had nothing come from it. They don't see the fact that you need to step on people to get ahead.
As a son of a low income mother who tried to explain to her multiple times with simple math how it's a bad thing and got met with silence and general apathy I wholeheartedly agree.
"My SIL is not what you might call scientifically literate. She has signed on to sell some weight loss pill that allegedly gets rid of belly fat.

She told my husband (her brother) that it's Linolenic acid. So she's selling omega 3 supplements basically and I dread to think how much she's invested into this and is charging people for something I can buy in my local supermarket for £4 for a month's supply."
I've got a friend going through an acrimonious divorce/asset division who is shilling what is so obviously an mlm. I tried politely declining when she tried to recruit me and she said she was surprised that someone as big on self improvement as I am is turning down such an amazing wealth building opportunity.
"Imagine you’re burnt out and at your wits end with no employment prospects. You know internally you have a 2% chance you’ll actually make money and get nothing but positive reinforcements on your “work.”

I can imagine suspending disbelief if I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs with no offers"
"Well, in all fairness they’re not marketed as MLMs or pyramid schemes…they’re usually sold as an “opportunity to work for yourself and make tons of money!”

And that’s why usually people who are down on their luck and struggling latch on to the “sale”."
AMWAY! (PUKE)
"Fake, RICH celebrities on Facebook begging for money."
"The number of time ""Vin Diesel"" has confessed his love to my mother on Facebook is wild. Man has a LOT of accounts"
"He's just trying to bring peace to the world, in the form of one big family."
Fambly
"To be fair, your mother is really hot."
"Vin diesel crying in his calabasas mansion as he makes another Facebook account, hoping cbostwick94’s mum will finally respond to this one"
"Weird. Wonder if he's related to Van Disell, the man who attempted to scam my mom with a cancer patient story. I always wondered if whoever was behind that attempt was watching Fast and Furious and quickly had to think of a name."
Why is it vin diesel so often 😆😆😆
"Hello, I am Vincent Ethanol, 
I need $500 in Amazon gift cards so I may buy a new car tonight , for the new Furious and Fast movie. 

Family. "
💀💀💀
He's a well liked person who is seen as comparatively honest and friendly. People also see him as less rich for some reason.
Aint figured that one out yet lol
"Hey but I got a message from Keanu himself. He even called me gorgeous, that's how I knew it wasn’t fake."
Of course he does! He’s fast and furious!
Vin is a very lonely man.
"It would be quite funny if Vin had seen your ma wheeling her trolley out of the Dollar Store and really had been bowled over with love for the old dame. For the last two years, he's, given up his whole career just to track her down; but she won't even speak to the bullet-headed multi-millionaire film star."
"Some of them are even worse where they do enough digging on the person they want to scam, find places they lived, and then fake that they are someone that lived in that area who knew of them, complete with pics of the person pulled from facebook. It's always a love scam, and always targeting someone who is elderly posting about their health conditions (especially mental health).

I intercepted one with my brother in law's mother and the texts went back for weeks of the scammer claiming to have done work on her old house she lived in years ago and had been in love with her ever since, now he was rich and working overseas and just needed someone to wire him money to get back to the states and marry her and take care of her. The amount of prep the scammer went through before the ask was amazing. Pretty sure that went we realized what was up (she was keeping it a secret from everyone else in the house, just like they asked her to) she was about to wire the money. I pretended to be her in the messaging and said that I wasn't sure about marrying him, unless he was willing to get pegged. Can't marry a man who wasn't willing to take it in the pooper with a strap-on. Scammer eventually realized he wasn't talking to an old woman anymore (which took him over an hour) and just started spamming expletives. Probably a solid months worth of work on their end, down the drain."
It's Post Malone on TikTok for me.  Sets up a super private secret account just to message his most valued fans...
Ugh my mom has lost tens of thousands of dollars sending it to her boyfriend “Vin Diesel” it’s so stupid
What the fuck
But I love her bro
"A friend of mine found out her boyfriend was having an emotional affair… with Charlize Theron. He absolutely refused to believe that the person he was texting wasn’t her. Why he believed a famous actress would need him to send her money is beyond me. 

The man is still completely deluding himself. He can’t possibly really believe it, but his ego won’t let him admit it."
"I absolutely love seeing the pleading for money ads they run for charity.

We need you to give money when you can barely afford to live while we just made a huge check for making this ad..... Gtfoh."
"To be fair, that doesn't mean it's a scam. Most legitimate charities run ads. Yes they have to pay for them, but they get a positive return on investment"
"While this may be true, I don't appreciate people who are so rich they're out of touch with reality telling my living paycheck to paycheck ass that I need to donate money to people who are ""wise off""."
"Or fake, RICH celebrities dating you online and then needing money from you (looking at you, endless variations of Johnny Depp that are all currently being dated simultaneously by women across America).

Celebrities don't need your money. They don't want to hang out with you or date you, any more than any other random social media user does. I've had them like my posts/comments, as some are pretty active online, or even a quick reply to a question, but they're not going to get involved with you. And they're not going to ask you to send them gift cards or cash wrapped in foil or whatever the fuck."
"Are you suggesting that Johnny isn't actually in love with me? 
/s"
"Romance scams are so sad. So many people really believe Brad Pitt ETC need money from them, mostly elderly men and women."
My elderly aunt is OBSESSED with a certain male celebrity. If anyone saw her Netflix history it would be easy to find out who. And I guarantee she would fall for a scam if “he” contacted her on Facebook. She would be beside herself.
"Stay diligent with her. My landlord who is in his 60’s is currently in a romance scam, but refuses to believe this. “She’s” the same age as his daughter and has promised to come many  times, but always has an “issue”. Not a celebrity, but for sure stolen pictures from a model or an only fans model. I’m sure it’s got to be some guy in another country scamming him. Awful."
"I CRINGE seeing people fall for this, they just want to be special so bad.."

"My mom currently thinks she’s dating Elon Musk. Yes, the richest man on earth is just going to randomly reach out to a 64 year old woman on Twitter to date. That’s how it works."
What the fuck 🤣 i don't understand how she could possibly think it's real
I wish I knew. I keep asking where her Tesla is and she’s got nothing.
Poor Kelly Clarkson always being used in this weight loss pills/gummies. And yiu can always tell by the mouth that it's ai bullshit.
"My aunt in her 70’s almost fell for that. It managed to catch on to it because “Carol Burnett Chat” wanted to be friends with me on FB. I ended up helping her delete, report & block a dozen fake accounts."
Doesn't help that Facebook makes it really easy for fan accounts to set profile names that aren't clear it's just a fan account.
"This one is particularly dumb.  Like , who thinks multimillionaire celebrities are messaging randoms on Facebook and asking for gift cards."
"Oh man, this blows my mind. Some ugly redneck in buttfuck nowhere thinks Johnny Depp is in love with them, but just needs some money as his is all tied up."
"A b-list, notoriously stupid, Italian celebrity actually thought she was chatting via Instagram DMs with Tom Cruise IN ITALIAN for several months"
Facebook is a quagmire of scams. The one I especially hate is the t shirt scam. “My autistic son designed this shirt and no one appreciates it.”Then a link for purchase. It’s despicable so many levels.
"My friends mother in law lost $30,000 to a relationship with Tom Jones that never worked out"
Not to mention when the actual real president of the US is doing it
"Ok for the last time his name is Donald Trump and he is rich for REAL, he just needs my help to fight the Deep State!"
KNAAAAAAAAWLEDGE
"Tbf, real rich celebrities asking for regular ppl to donate to charity also feels like a scam."

Tbf that seems like our politicians during campaign time.
Paying money to the “IRS” in the form of Apple gift cards
"One of my colleagues had a roommate (randomly paired - they didn’t know one another) who fell for this sort of scam. The roommate got a call from the IRS saying they owed $25,000 in back taxes of some kind and if they didn’t pay within X days by sending gift cards to some place in TX (we were on the east coast), they would give them over to the FBI who would come immediately. Why anyone with an advanced degree in a competitive field would fall for this is beyond me, but the roommate called up their grandparents to borrow some of the money to pay it and several people contributed to the $25k that they actually then sent, per the instructions. There was never any proof of why there would be so much in back taxes and I don’t think this person had a career that would have paid anything large because we were all students + working at the time. 

I’m also not sure why they were worried about the FBI as if they were going to be sent away without even so much as a payment plan or garnished wages being on the table first. Crazy. Also, who has family wealthy enough that they could cobble together $25k from a handful of people in days and NO ONE questioned it??? "
">Also, who has family wealthy enough that they could cobble together $25k from a handful of people in days and NO ONE questioned it??? 

Wish I had that family, damn."
"Well, boy oh boy are you in luck, because my name happens to be IRS and YOU, my friend, owe me 25,000 dollars that need to be paid within X amount of days, or the FBI will take you away without warning. Please have the 25,000 sent in various forms of various gift cards and sent to me, IRS as soon as possible. Thanks!
//IRS"
If I asked my dad for $10 he would ask me why I needed it. He would probably give it to me regardless but he would ask. 
"I'm not your family, but I can get you $25k tomorrow! Just gonna need $1k for the transfer fees - can you mail that?"
"Wouldn't you prefer a family that questioned it, kept your money safe, and explained the situation to you?"
"No, I'll use their money to buy cocaine."
"The kind of family that *really* doesn't want the FBI knocking, I guess."
Fun fact: the IRS does not make phone calls. All of their communication is through snail mail.
Yeah and they will never collect money via randomly mailed gift cards because that is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. The govt is the one who produces money??? Why do they need untraceable gift cards? People should face some kind of penalty like community service for being dumb enough to fall for this sort of thing. 
They've already been punished for falling for it. Maybe banks who are alerted to this should run anti fraud classes in exchange for refunding the money?
"To their credit, I have heard of retail chains where if people come in buying large amounts of gift cards, they recognize the red flag and try to explain to the person that if they are buying the gift cards to pay some debt, no legitimate organization accepts payment in gift cards.

As I understand it, it doesn't always work."
Pretty much every big box store in my area has signs near the gift cards explaining the scams and warning the IRS does not ask for gift cards for payment.
"If you're not able to identify that the 25K the ""IRS"" asked you to post to a random residential address is a scam then I'm not sure what an anti-fraud class is going to do for you."
"To be fair, it doesn't help that [IRS hinders cash payments](https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2023/04/10/i-tried-to-pay-my-taxes-in-cash-heres-what-happened/) almost maliciously."
"In Canada, we can pay income taxes at any post office, including in cash, but like this article states, there is a limit (I think on some quick googling that it's also $1,000, though I don't know if that's per-payment/day, or an annual total). There is also a service fee based on the amount.

The bottom line, however, is that it is easier to pay in other ways, but not so much easier that it's a farce. If you have cash, get a bank account, put it into your bank account, and pay your taxes directly from your bank account. Or write a cheque. Or get a bank draft. Or use a credit or debit card.

I have never tried to pay my electric or gas or property tax bill in cash either, but I expect that's similarly difficult.

But there's a difference between ""refusing"" cash, and ""discouraging"" cash or cash simply being inconvenient to pay. And there's a difference between recommending a credit card or direct payment through your bank compared to recommending ""gift cards"", which is not a method of payment that any legitimate entity accepts as a form of payment (other than the company the card is for).

Now, I suppose if they were asking you to buy like... those instant prepaid visa/mastercard ""gift cards"", that might be another story and might drift into surface plausibility - but my understanding is they more commonly are asking for retail gift cards like Amazon or Best Buy or whatever.


Edit: The article's punchline of:

>For people without bank accounts, their only option for paying taxes shouldn’t require paying fees to credit card processors or retailers – especially since they are likely among the poorest taxpayers.

Is somewhat valid, but the article's complaint with retailers accepting cash tax payments was not the fees, but the difficulty:

>The IRS also has partnered with national chains like CVS, Walgreens, 7-Eleven and Family Dollar to accept cash on its behalf. Their service fees are less, either $1.50 or $2.50 per payment. However, the steps needed to navigate the online program before you can show up at a retailer seemed almost as difficult as filling in the tax forms.

Paying $1.50 or $2.50 as a convenience fee to pay your annual taxes, even for the 'poorest taxpayers' is simply not large enough to be relevant. The difficulty in the steps needed to do it seems like the bigger problem."
">People should face some kind of penalty like community service for being dumb enough to fall for this sort of thing. 

I love it! Introduce some shame to the equation!

*Your intelligence is bad, and you should feel bad, too!*"
"I'm am so waiting for the IRS call again so I can ask if the cards should be sent to Ogden, Ohio or Cincinnati, Utah.  I want to see if they catch the state switch."
"This is probably true 99% of the cases but if you're weird enough of a case, they will actually call. As a matter of fact, so does the SSA. But it won't be out of the blue, something must have been set in motion already beforehand. Source: I was called by the IRS and SSA, and in both cases it was about something very specific."
"They'll never call you _out of the blue_ is the point. When the IRS calls you, it's part of something that's already happening -- meaning you've got an ongoing case with them in some way. You've opened it yourself, or they've sent you a lot of mail already about it and _now_ they're calling you.

They will never threaten jail over the phone, nor will they accept any form of payment other than the standard check/wire-transfer type instrument."
SSA scheduled a call with my dad to discuss my late mother's SSA payments. I was still sketched out about it knowing that he is older and has previously fallen for the giftcard scam. Luckily this one was all legit.
"The amount of people who don't understand this very basic thing with a lot of scams. My Gf nearly fell for one, luckily I was there when it happened. Had a buddy get a call from Windows, saying his computer was having some security issues. Took way longer to convince him it was a scam, because 1 why in the hell would they work for Windows... the operating system, not Microsoft? 2 and this is the really mind bogling part his only computer was a goddam Mac Book. Why the fuck would Windows be calling about your Apple product?"
"And number 3, why would Microsoft ever monitor your computer to the point where they can tell you're ""having security issues"" but also be unable to do anything about them without you installing some sketchy 3rd-party tool?"
Yup. And if you ignore the paper long enough they just start garnishing your wages.
"I worked for the IRS. The only time the IRS will call you if you have a Taxpayer Advocate assigned to a tax matter. Any other instance, the IRS mails correspondences due to this particular reason."
"Yup. IRS will never call. Snail mail with one piece of identifying info such as a part of your tax id or last four of social.

Now there are clones of snail mail minus this one piece of info, and it’s the only way to tell real from fake."
"I feel bad for elderly people the most. These scammers know what they’re doing when they target them. They’re much less likely to be up to date on the current methods used to get their money. My mom is 67, and although she’s fairly tech savvy for her age, I still fill her in any time I hear of a new method."
The IRS does call *after* snail mail communications and an appointment is set up on a particular day and time with a named agent.  So yes there are calls but you have a stack of paperwork to look through before it actually happens.
Ok. Theyre never gonna call and say you have to send them Walmart and iTunes gift cards to avoid immediate arrest. That better?
Also in order to have 25k in back taxes you would have had to pay zero taxes on like 100k in income?? Idk about you but most college kids are clearing that kind of income
"The big question I had about the whole thing was why they never followed up to ask for help from any of the dozens of resources they could have used, and why they felt like the threat of law enforcement was serious. Now, I imagine they must have been into some recreational drug use or something kinda shady. Maybe they were worried about their career options if they were hoping to work for the govt in the future, but still. "
"Fear of authority is drummed into people pretty hard all the way through college. And often beyond, depending on the kind of workplaces they're in. I know plenty of people in their 50s who are still terrified of even lightly questioning their boss about obvious errors, because they think they'll be loudly and publicly fired over it.

And because there _are_ some petty authoritarians out there, it reinforces the idea that it's a risk most people have to be aware of."
Closer to 200k.
"It's possible to have back taxes kind of balloon, though. Happened to a friend where they made a pretty serious filing error 3 years in a row (not declaring income from a side hustle) -- actual _tax_ owed was about $10k total, but with all the penalties and interest it was quite a bit more."
"I know people who have been in a similar situation and they wound up taking out a personal loan to pay it. FYI to a lot of people, the govt will often allow you to do payment plans for things if you owe them a lot of money. Not always, but there are a lot of options for that sort of thing. 

This person should have known they in no way would have been obligated to pay this much for anything because they weren’t making much money, unless they were profiting from something illegal/off the books. "
"100% - the IRS can be scary if you're actually doing criminal tax evasion. But otherwise, they genuinely will want to work with you to come correct. 

I've had businesses with very complicated tax situations, messed it up to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and had the IRS waive penalties and interest when I made it clear that I wanted to do the legal thing but just misunderstood. They helped me figure out what the right thing was and set up a payment plan and everything."
"Ya the IRS isn’t as scary as they want you to think they are understaffed and their lawyers are under payed, my uncles best friend has a back tax deal with them that he has to live to 135 to pay off lol"
"If he owns property, they’ll take it at the time of his death. He may have something in the agreement that says he can’t sell it or put it in a trust without the IRS first taking their share. If he doesn’t own property, the IRS probably just knows it’s not worth trying to pursue him if he’s mostly making payments, unless they’re garnishing his wages. "
"My mom once called me in a panic because the “IRS” called her and said they’d be sending police to the house to arrest me (I think I was about 38 at the time, hadn’t lived at home in years) and even though it made no sense she thought it was real. Luckily she called me directly to check before doing anything else."
"Seriously my family is mostly middle classes but if I told them I need $25k they'd be like, what illegal shit did you do, or are you trying to scam us."
 Could have bought a fucking house
Just because people can regurgitate information on que doesn't mean they're smart.
I mean plenty of people have that kind of money but usually it would come with the brains to question it 
"The reason these scams work is because a large percentage of people (especially college kids) have never been on the business end of law enforcement so they don’t know what to expect.  If you’ve never gotten a threatening letter from the IRS because you forgot to send in your W-2 with your return (they threatened me with tax fraud charges unless I sent a corrected return stating I had 0 income and was entitled to no refund, or, in very fine print, I could also send in the form W-2 and have my return processed as-is) or something you don’t know how they operate. "
Friends wife got stopped in the process of doing same.  He grabbed the phone and told them to send the feds. They hung up
"My aunt once got one of those calls, she responded back with ""that's impossible, I've never had to pay taxes my entire life!"" and the guy went silent for a good 10 seconds before the line disconnected. It was pretty funny."
"I worked IT support for my college while I attended, I can attest firsthand that being ""intelligent"" is a far cry from being ""smart."" Far and away the biggest offenders for having accounts compromised were the professors."
"> NO ONE questioned it

I assume once you get the first person to believe it, they tell the others that ""so and so is in trouble with the IRS and needs help, can you spare anything"" and they don't get all the details and just assume you're not a moron."
"When I was in the navy my roommate got an email from ""the united state Americans federal FBI"" accusing him of having bad things on his computers.  He had to pay 5,000 in Walmart gift cards.  Or the CIA was going to come and arrest him and put him in jail for 52 years.

Dude tripped balls he found a way to get the money.   He sold his car for a chunk of it.

I thought his reaction was suspicious af.  While he was scrambling for money I started digging on his computer.... Anyway the base police were there to arrest him when he got back"
Plot twist: The roommate faked the scam and got a lot of free money from friends 😆
Your friend was most likely doing something they shouldn't have been doing.  People don't fall this hard for this type of scam without believing it's true.  It can only be believed to be true if the target was doing something wrong in the first place.  The other reason is they are just stupid as hell.
Definitely not my friend lol 
"They're doing something wrong or they're stupid.  One of two choices, it can't be neither.  No smart person would fall for it and someone doing something questionable legally it might scare them."
"Bro I literally don’t know this person. I mean they’re actually not my friend. Idk if they’re dumb or shady cause I don’t personally know them, I just know about one of the worst things they’ve probably ever done because their roommate was completely flabbergasted by what happened. "
Why you stick up for this dude you don't know like I insulted your mother or some shit?
"??? I did not stand up for this person whatsoever. Maybe you need your eyes checked. They’re not my friend, that’s all I said. I just kinda knew this person once-upon-a-time. Don’t even remember their name. "
"I got scammed out of $21,000 and my parents bailed me out. So like, some people are able to afford it. I was a dumb kid and fell for an employment scam"
"It’s one thing for parents to bail you out and a totally different thing for them to give you money to give to a scammer though…. I had a colleague who was scammed out of $3k+ through an employment scam where a “researcher” sent out a recruiting email asking for someone to do work for their study which included buying gift cards for participants and being reimbursed later on + wages. She should’ve known better but sometimes those scams can look pretty convincing so I understand how she got past step #1, it’s just a little tougher with step #2 which is spending thousands of your own money. Someone bailed her out, she learned a tough lesson, and now she’s working a real job. If she had asked any of us or her parents or an advisor, we would have all spotted the red flag and none of us would have given her money that would have gone to the scammers (I think, anyway). "
"No it wasn’t like that, they didn’t know it was a scammer either but I was using my own money. But I would’ve been $15k in the hole if they didn’t give me the $15k after. It was tough bc the scammer was using the name of a guy who my mom knew actually did work at this rehab place so the guy I was working for was someone I knew. Except it actually wasn’t. It was dumb. But trust me, I’m an expert on scams now"
"I feel like if you fall for something like that, that's a good reason to get fired even if it happens in your personal life. That's someone who falls for phishing and gives out corporate secrets, or pays bogus invoices."
The gullibility of people is how Trump gets millions to vote for him.

They’re told how to answer so I’m not sure this would be effective. I would straight up ask them if someone is forcing them to purchase these as a repayment for something.
I work in retail- it’s shocking to me how many people get genuinely angry that you think they’re being scammed. I’ve been screamed and berated as people insist they know what they’re doing only to find out they were wrong. I refused one lady because she was buying cards to purchase a dog- I asked certain questions and decided I wasn’t making the sale as she was definitely being scammed. She called me a dumb bitch and said she wanted me fired when she came back in with her dog. Never did get to see that puppy!

I really can't fathom someone requesting payment for anything with a gift card. Gift cards are a fucking hassle and I have a bout a dozen that I have never even used.
"Yeah the only gift cards I want are for groceries or gas.

I hate getting one that tells me ""hey now you need to go to this place you probably weren't planning on"", when I just gave them a thing they might use in their house."
"Yeah, gift cards should just be banned. I've always found it super weird that some people actually give them as gifts. If I ever got one, I'd tell the gift giver to just not give me a gift next time, or give the amount in cash if they really insist."
"They come in handy for people who don't have a credit card or paypal (yes, I'm from Germany) or don't want to enter their banking info online (yes, I really am from Germany)."
"> we have the highest employment rate in the county and a lot of the students are desperate to get jobs.

why are they desperate to get jobs when the employment rate is doing so well?"
"just not enough jobs. Everyone who wants a job can find one?… but. that means there are not enough jobs to  go around for everyone person who wants one?  Currently, people who can’t find any other way to make money are falling for those gift card scams (from the OP) 

At least. That’s how I understood it!! I think this is just clunky wording on my part ^ but I’m adhd and I’m confusing myself "
"Sounds more like high *un*employment.

High employment is more jobs to go around relative to people looking (so it's easier for everyone to find one)."
"My local convenience store has signs up by their gift card displays saying ""Consumer Alert: no law enforcement, including the IRS or FBI, accepts payment in gift cards. If you've been asked to buy gift cards to pay a tax bill or judgement, call the below number for help."" and the number is a local consumer-protection group."
"That is awesome, more stores should have that."
Is there ever a different reason?
"I had to hammer it into my parent's heads about these scams, so they never fall for it. Now my parents just mess with the scammers when they call them. lol


The ones that pretend to be lawyers or attorneys are worrying though."
"That's fraught with risk, including possible revenge. More one interacts with scammers, more chance of being scammed. Talk with your parents and emphasize they should screen their calls (not answering is best; landlines tend to be worse) or hangup immediately. Not worth messing with scammers.

No one knows every scam nor variation. Everyone is susceptible to be scammed given the right conditions. In a rush, coincidence, etc.

Also, many rely on various 3rd parties when determining whether an interaction is real or not. Sometimes that trust can be misplaced. Friend's emails, social media, phone, etc compromised (very common) allowing a fraudster to gather information and even interject.

Happens a lot with real estate closings. Buyer is told to wire funds to the settlement company, but unknown to either party involved, someone is eavesdropping. Then interjects at the opportune time with bogus wire instructions. Could be an email or even a phone call. Yes, this is a known scam, but most still unaware. And some variations (ie. voice spoofing) will appear so legit that most buyers would never question it.

Sure, others can come up with better examples. Rambling on, but this is something I had to explain to a relative. Didn't even realize how close they'd come to be scammed. They were lucky. Not all are."
"“This is the IRS, send money plz”"
Shit. You found me. You accept Apple gift cards?
PayPal?
Nope. Too secure. What if I let you control my screen and log in to my bank directly?
Oh no—
Send Friends & Family pls
You mean like my husband did?

"""Kindly"""
"This is the kindly IRS, send money plz"
And if you would do the needful and not redeem first

Or you will be under the rest
hey its me ur irs
Knock knock
"Obviously they will only take Doge once Elon is done making the government ""more efficient"""
"Tbf, that's not the most absurd thing."
"Ha. My wife had a coworker get a call. She was visibly frazzled and said she had to leave in a rush to take care of something urgent. 

Apparently it was one of these. She rushed to get around $5000 worth of gift cards. They got it all. 

The kicker is my wife works in a joint business that does financial advising, insurance and accounting. If she would have brought it up to anyone (her boss being a CPA and extremely knowledgeable on tax law) they could have told her it immediately was a scam. The IRS does not call people. They send letters. And no way in hell is any government body accepting gift cards?? 

I felt bad for her because there was no way in getting the money back but she had help so close but panicked and left instead."
"I'm just reading all these and thinking, does the IRS actually get gift cards sent by mail from some of these people? It would be hilarious to hear that they have a ""dumb people sending us shit we didn't ask for"" pool."
"Our friend's mom almost  fell for this. She got a call that her grandson was in a Mexican jail and she needed to send $20K for bail money. They really got her whipped into a lather to the point she drove to the bank to go withdraw the money.

Thankfully, her son was a co-signer on the account. So, the teller excused herself and discreetly called the son to let him know what was going on. He told the teller to stall, he and his son got in their car and went straight to the bank to stop it and show her her grandson was fine! $20K loss averted and the son said if she EVER got a call like that again to hang up immediately and call him. He'd handle whatever was going on (which in 99% of cases would be absolutely nothing).

Thankfully the teller was caring and astute."
"> If she would have brought it up to anyone (her boss being a CPA and extremely knowledgeable on tax law) they could have told her it immediately was a scam. 

But that might be _embarassing_. Scammers rely very heavily on fear as a motivator for action and shame as a motivator for keeping the conversation private.

It's why these things are almost always some variant of ""you've been a very bad person and everyone will know if you don't act quickly"" -- from IRS scams to sextortion. And it's also why it works even with stuff entirely _made up_. I got contacted by a scammer who sent me info from my public LinkedIn profile and said they'd contact all my colleagues and tell them I was having an affair and that they ""had very convincing evidence"".

This works on people because they're so afraid that _even though it's not true_, they'll be shamed and embarrassed. And that means they're unlikely to seek help to solve the problem. (In my case, I'm polyam and don't need to keep that a secret, so it was just funny; but I can definitely understand why a lot of people would be freaked out enough that their judgement would be impaired long enough for the scam to work)."
This! 
I knew of someone who fell for basically every single thing banks all say not to do. :|
"[There was a story that went viral last year](https://www.thecut.com/article/amazon-scam-call-ftc-arrest-warrants.html) about a financial advice columnist who got scammed into handing $50,000 of her savings in a shoebox to a random stranger."
They fired her right? ….right?!
I really hope so.
She quit shortly after this. It was for some ridiculous reason too but I can’t remember.
"Man, you guys are rough."
"This is a person involved in a company that provides financial/investment/tax services, and they fell for an obvious scam.  They are a danger to the business' clients."
No worries she was not advising anyone herself and she quit shortly after this incident.
"While I don't think falling for a scam is grounds on its own to be fired, I can tell you that to work for an investment broker, the broker is legally required to investigate your debts and any kind of hole you might legally be in when they hire you. You have to fill out a questionnaire every year disclosing if you have any outside business, if you've arranged for a alternate form of loan repayment etc."
"Yeah, but I'm guessing this person wasn't actually advising anyone.  She was probably just some office drone.  Possibly should have been fired anyway, but it's one thing to grudgingly do it because it's necessary and another thing to be hungry for someone who's already been scammed to have her livelihood stripped away just because she was a little naive."
Even if she's an office drone she's handling other people's sensitive information.
"By the time the IRS is calling you, you've spoken to an IRS agent in the flesh at least once and you are expecting the call."
DO NOT REDEEEEEMMMM!!!
Ma’am! Ma’am!!!!
WHY DID YOU DO THAT??? WHY DID YOU DO THAT???
You're killing me. You just killed me.
Mother toad!!!
Kitboga is fucking hilarious. Especially how he plays an old lady. I love when he starts cursing them out in hindi .
The old lady voice is the best haha
"It's mother chode btw, chode meaning fucker"
Ahh Kitboga. Classic
"That guy freaking out is a meme at this point. Like holy shit, but he lost his *marbles*."
"Right?

He really is doing the lord's work when it comes to scambaiting and I love it

Pleasant Green is another great channel when it comes to this stuff"
Jim Browning is another one I enjoy a lot. The one where he was able to get access to the CCTV in the call centre and fuck with them telling them what they were wearing and their real names and stuff is gold. You get to watch them freaking out in real time.
"MA’AM, ARE YOU PROSTITUTE?!"
You will end up behind the bars!
"If anyone is reading this that doesn't understand this reference, please go look it up because it's an hilarious example of a scammer getting screwed over"
that rage brings me profound joy.
"""This is the IRS, but you have to pay us in gift cards from Walmart. If anyone asks the gift cards are for your grandson. DO NOT TELL THE STAFF/LAW ENFORCEMENT WHAT YOU ARE DOING."""
"Well, they say they're from the IRS so you can trust them.  I'd do what they ask."
And never mind the Indian accent. His name is John McAmericanman so you know you can trust him.
I’ve been paying my taxes this way for years!
"I nearly fell for this. I did owe back taxes and I had been stressed about it at the time. The call made sense to me for that reason. They actually wanted me to pay via debit card, and the only thing that saved me was forgetting my wallet at home that day.

The scammer was ready to wait on the phone with me for 30 minutes while I drove home to get my card to pay. I started getting suspicious and texted my dad. He just texted back “hang up immediately”. I ended up being glad I wasted close to 30 minutes of these assholes’ time.

Always be skeptical!"
The IRS doesn’t cold call people. They ALWAYS send a letter.
"I remember someone pointing out once that the IRS *did* call them first, but then they also noted that it was a business account, not an individual one.

There needs to be written records, which a phone call doesn't provide. They will send a letter, you will send a letter or form back at some point, whatever. At some point, a conversation will happen, but there will also be a record. What's the proof of what you owed? What's the proof that your Target gift cards went through and were applied? There isn't any. Anyone demanding money from you should be able to provide written proof--debt buyers can't provide it, and IRS scammers can't provide it.

Another group that doesn't call first is the police, or FBI, not *when they're going to arrest you*. Like, ""send us these gift cards right now or we'll send the police to your house."" Nope, not a thing. If there's a valid reason for the cops/FBI to come arrest you, they'll just do that. It tends not to work in their favor to warn criminals of their plans ahead of time, weirdly."
"Plus, they are always willing to negotiate. They know that if their systems show you owe $25k in taxes, there’s a damn good chance you screwed up filing your return. 

They’ll invite you to come in and work through your return and look over your records and all the rest. Your debt just might vanish once you correct the errors. Or the IRS will settle for pennies on the dollar. 

IRS is one of the easier federal agencies to work with. Just don’t come in screaming about the injustice of paying taxes. Or that you’re a sovereign citizen or some other variety of kook. Talk like that and IRS will break you into a 1000 pieces and scatter you in the wind."
"yep, US First Class Priority Mail"
"At least getting you to make a debit card over the phones *makes sense* in the context of paying a tax debt.

Even just thinking about it for a second, ***why*** would the IRS want Apple iTunes cards???"
"That's at least more believable than most of these scams. ""Pay via debit card"" is a much more believable option than ""go buy gift cards and give us the numbers"", and as you said, the call fit your circumstances which was lucky for the scammer.

The big red flag I wish we'd hammer home for more people is that ""created urgency"". There is _never_ a legitimate thing so urgent that someone who calls you needs payment _while you're on the phone_ in order to avoid some dire consequence. No matter who supposedly needs money, you should be able to say ""ok, let me get a reference number from you and I'll call back"", and then call a number you get from a trusted online source (like irs.gov for the IRS) without any issue.

Even fucking _bill collectors_ will happily give you their license number, company name and address, etc. and are required to send you proof of the debt in the mail."
"Also, it's good to remember that there's almost never a situation like this that can't wait. If there's even a single thing that raises the slightest alarm, just ask for the contact information and say you'll get back with them tomorrow or something. Then go check it out, ask for help, etc, and you'll see that it's almost certainly a scam. If it was actually legitimate, it can wait. 

This also works for things that aren't actually scams but are just bad deals. Like if you're thinking of buying something but you think it might be overpriced. Oh, it might not be a *scam*, you might actually be getting what's promised. But if you're being encouraged to buy now because it's gonna be gone by the time you get back, good chance that it's *at least* just a really bad deal. 

When someone says **ACT NOW**, that is often a huge red flag. Obviously doesn't always apply to stuff like disaster scenarios, but when it comes to dealings with governments and businesses this stuff can almost always wait. If they're saying that you can't wait, then it's probably bullshit and they're just utilizing fear (whether that be fear of penalties or fear of missing out) to override peoples' critical thinking abilities."
"That's the thing.  They catch you off balance when you're not expecting it, and are often good at keeping you off balance and not giving time to think.

Doesn't work every time, but you catch someone offguard in the wrong mindset, and it can easily loop into ""admitting I'm falling for it would be worse than continuing onward"" mental state.

Good thought on texting a 3rd party to get another brain involved."
Yea you were dumb af
Thanks! So constructive!
"When I was 18, I got a call from the “IRS”, informing me that they were sending an officer to my home address immediately due to tax evasion. They insisted I had evaded over $8,000 in taxes over the last two years.

Somehow I thought, as a sleepy (having just woken up) 18 year old kid, that I had accidentally not paid taxes on my summer job that made me a very, *very* tiny fraction of that total.

I panicked and was on the verge of a complete meltdown, just as he demanded some of my more sensitive information to keep the officers from coming to the house. I thought, “if they were coming to arrest me, wouldn’t they not care if I paid money? If I commit a crime, I can’t just pay it away, that makes no sense.”

(Not to mention I had very little money to my name as it was, lol.) 

Anyway, I emailed my mom and stalled the guy on the phone, just long enough for her to reply with “THE IRS NEVER CALLS YOU!!!!!”

I told him I had figured him out and asked him why on earth he would do this to innocent people — he told me to go fuck myself and hung up on me. Lmfao"

"I work for a bank and recently had a new elderly couple come in and open a business account they were obnoxious and rude to work with and not even a week after they opened the account they were scammed into getting a ""loan"" all they had to do was send the loan officer $800 in apple gift cards... they were sent 2 checks not even close to their loan amount and you can guess what happened after they tried to cash the checks... 

The husband was nice and literally had a stroke a few days later when we broke the news to him. His wife on the other hand is a major cunt and was in denial despite literally showing them proof that they were scammed..."
"I appreciate all of the minimum wage employees that spend a ton of time trying to stop this sort of thing. A couple years ago I commissioned a painting from an artist that happened to live in Argentina, so it was easiest to wire transfer the money to her. 

I literally had to pull up her Instagram profile to show the woman at the Western Union counter that I wasn’t falling for a scam. You could tell she saw it happen all the time, and I think she was relieved that I was just a millennial with too much money to spend on a watercolor portrait of my dogs."
"I wish it was possible to buy one for a penny just to send that.

I am the IRS. I will arrest you! If the cashier at best buy tells you you're getting scammed don't listen to them and tell them it's for your grand kid!
I know someone who INSISTED that she needed to buy $500 in iTunes gift cards or the “department of the government” was going to come put her in prison. She could not identify why she owed this money. Just insisted that the department of the government called her saying she owed them money.
"I don't understand why they think a government agency would be that subtle, especially the IRS."
Once got one where they pretended to be the electric company. Played along until they asked for account number. I told them 123-456-789 and they got so pissed!
"I got one yesterday claiming to be from my mobile carrier. One problem, the one I use used UK call centres only and has no offshore call centres, and they were claiming to be able to offer me a 70% discount on my current contract without paying extra to buy out the current one to upgrade early. Yeah, the multi million pound earning data carrier is going to just be offering customers huge discounts for no reason. Right. Also, I'm out of contract and on a sim-only plan. The woman spent a long time trying to convince me that they really were that company and really were offering the discount to 'long term customers for their loyalty.' She got very upset with me when I informed her I actually used to work for that company in question and knew exactly where all the legit call centres were located and that billing dials out on one number only. Asked a bunch of jargon filled questions about GDPR and the ICO and long distance selling rights and she just hung up. That was the 3rd time they called so it will be interesting to see if they call again so that I can waste some more of their time!"
"Do they still accept Apple gift cards? I figure that the ""IRS"" moved on to crypto."
"I recently had a guy calling claiming to be from the US Office of the Inspector General. Sounds big I guess? But the real OIG is purely government oversight. They look for waste and fraud in government agencies. I wanted to play along to see what the scam was but the guy was using my real name and I didn’t want to validate their dataset. So I told him I had no idea who that was and he hung up on me. I still would be fascinated in knowing the scam. (For reference my job is related to anti-robocalling efforts, so I’ve heard most of these. OIG was definitely a new one though.)"
"My husband has had to stop older coworkers of his from falling for this more than once. I have a less glamorous job, but I do work with Barely Adult people, and I've made it my life's mission while I'm in this industry to teach them as much about taxes as I can, partially because everyone should understand the basics, but also to avoid these situations."
"Ages ago I read an article about a man who got scammed. He got a call saying that he won a contest. He hadn't taken part in one, but his wife regularly does and uses both their names, so he didn't think anything of it and thought it was legit.

They said he had the choice between a brand new Mercedes or 70,000€. He chose the money, and they said that to oversee the transfer they needed to hire a notary which costs like 500€ and that he'd have to pay up front (which he didn't mind since he'd get 70,000€ later), but the notary they always hire for this doesn't trust the banking system, so he only accepts payment in form of Steam gift cards.

So this guy went to a local store, bought a 500€ Steam gift card, called back the number they gave him, told them the code, they said they'd verify it and call him back later, and he never heard from them again."

"Reminds me of the time several years ago when my computer suddenly locked up and a screen popped up saying that I’d been caught viewing child pornography (I’ve never) and that I was about to get in BIG TROUBLE with the authorities, but that all these problems (including the locked computer) would go away if I just purchased a Walmart gift card.  

I was pretty sure that wasn’t how the law worked, and thankfully everything was back to normal after I restarted my computer."
I straight up asked them are you scamming me and he replies no this is David Johnson in New York City office
I can't pay the IRS in Steam gift cards?!
"I don't care who the IRS sends,  I am not paying my taxes!"

"There are some versions of this that are a little more insidious: They essentially frame it as, ""They're about to arrest you for this debt. I'll put up the money and keep you out of trouble. You just repay me in gift cards so there's no paper trail and they don't know I helped you."""
My question is how are apple gift cards redeemable for cash?
"Though sometimes I have free time and want to fuck with these people.

One day I strung a guy along for like 6 hours. I went and bought a bunch of gift cards and ended up giving them to my nephews for christmas, but I took a bunch of pictures of the front of the gift cards and kept ""misinterpreting"" their instructions. like sending the back of the gift card without them scratched off, and then with them covered by my hand, etc.

Then I sent a picture of some dude's dick I got from the internet.

He was big mad. 10/10 would do again if I had time."

Paying anything to the irs is hilarious as there is no law stating you need to pay taxes. It's all a scam to see who does.

"Bro my fucking cousin is some kind of very high up position at Cutco. He constantly posts videos traveling to these sales meetings, talking about how many hundreds of thousands they’ve done in sales. He been in it since he fell into it in college, and I guess he’s one of the rare success stories. I have no experience with the company other than on the mlm groups, and the fact that everyone in our family has bought knives from him lol"
"They all post those success stories, and almost all of them are complete lies. They'll literally fill their garages with products they purchased through themselves to generate those sales to make up those stories.

>He constantly posts videos traveling to these sales meetings

They pay to attend those. If you know anything at all about attending conferences, you know that you get **paid** to attend. Your ticket, travel, hotel, and food are paid for as well as being paid your usual salary. (I don't know how conferences work in academics very well)"
"You pay to attend academic conferences. your university might cover travel, but you are definitely paying out of pocket and getting reimbursed. 


Other professional conferences depend. A lot of them are paid for as part of the job, unless it's something extra you want to do. But you aren't getting *extra* to go... it's just part of your job."
Kind of like the Miracle Salve episode on the Andy Griffith show?
Cutco is an actually good product though. They do have salespeople who make $80k in a season. Expensive as shit though.
"The problem, if I remember correctly, was that there were pop ups that were not or only tangentially related. Those were the scams. My buddy also had a good time, maxe decent money. The one I went to, and anyone else I knew that had experience tho, went to a scammer"
I was in it. If you are good and grind you actually can make a lot. The problem is most people dont want to sell knives to their friends and family and are probably not that good at selling.
You know what sucks? My bf and I have Cutco knives and they're great and they have a warranty program to get them sharpened for free. I'm embarrassed to have them but I'll never get rid of them.
"Does Cutco do it under their brand now? They used to use 3rd party solicitors. I know because my HS crush reached out to me one college summer and signed me the fuck up instantly lol, a VP at Vector Marketing lol."
"He knows enough dumb people to buy from him (as you've mentioned), which is unusual. That gets him ahead of the rest. Every family has one or two dumb guys, but multiple? That's VERY unusual. Unless you live in Alabama, Mississippi or Texas. "
Nah MLMers make their money by recruiting others. Not selling product.
"Exactly. I had a friend growing up who was pretty well off by the standards of my area. Always had the latest gaming system, a dirt bike, and went snowboarding all the time during winter.  His mom was in an MLM but mostly recruited people into it and sold large quantities to them rather than selling to actual customers.  

My parents hated her. Any time I hung out with that guy, they'd have me walk to a nearby park and pick me up from there just to avoid having her try to recruit them."
"Yep. All the people they recruit, and the ones those recruit and so on are called a ""downline"" and they get kickbacks from every single person's product purchased. So if you recruit 5 people, and they all recruit 5 people, and everyone makes $1000 with you getting a 20% cut, they made $800 and you made $4k. And actually they may have lost money due to paying for stock and fees. Those people go on to each recruit 5 more and then you tack on 125 people to your downline. Same numbers and you make $29,000. But the people at the bottom of the downline (not pyramid cuz people get offended when you call it that) actually selling product are still only making $800 or losing money. Another level of 5 each and you pull 156k. 

You can see why it's considered a pyramid scheme and very few actually make money. You have to get in on someone's downline to be able to sell product. There's no way for everyone to be able to make decent money. There literally has to be people making nothing or even ending up net negative for others to have a downline and profit."
"cutco/vector marketing is not an MLM.  don't get me wrong, i'm not saying they're a legit reputable company.  it's just that their specific scammyness is not the MLM model.  it's a rather unique system of basically recruiting en masse proxy sales people.  if they went around to 300 houses in a neighborhood trying to sell knives to strangers it would take a week and they'd maybe sell 4 sets, but if they hold a seminar and recruit people's kids to have their parents and friends buy, they hit those same 300 houses with only 4 hours of work and a 40% success rate.  they don't do the downline thing or make you fill your garage with product.  instead they set unattainable goals, and make you quit on your own after you sold to your first and second level contacts.  i mean they can't do the garage filling because their product isn't prettied up garbage the way that herbalife or lularoe stuff is, it's actually quality durable goods they can't afford to saturate the market with."
"Do you remember that scene from The Office where Michael is trying to explain how he's not part of a pyramid scheme, he just needs to recruit a couple of people to sell the product, then they recruit more people, and everyone gets a cut? That's the EXACT sales plan for Cutco. They're whole thing is, ""You start off selling, and then you get people to sell for you, and they get people to sell for them, and you climb out corporate ladder until you can stop selling because everyone you recruited makes the money for you."""
"no, vector marketing does not do that.  but again let me reiterate, this is not defending them.  i'm just explaining that the way their scam works is a different scam than an MLM, it's still a scam."
Cutco! It’s a scam to sell but damn those are good knives.
"One of my best friends back in the day got into Cutco and I bought a couple of the knives because I knew she was in an awful situation at the time. I'm shocked they don't have a better business model because they REALLY are good knives.


ETA: People have really strong opinions about these knives, apparently"
"Blows my mind that quality products get into MLM stuff or stay in that space after being established, you'd think they'd have better brand loyalty by putting them in stores / online. Tupperware is a good case study for switching from 'direct marketing' to more legitimate business practice."
"Avon makeup as well. I also really enjoyed a lot of pampered chef things as a kid. Nowadays it's easy to find all these specialty kitchen tools online and have it shipped to your door, but back in the 90s, the pampered chef introduced my family to a lot of neat products you couldnt find in stores. We still have some of them!"
Tupperware filed for bankruptcy a few months ago…
"Cheap ceramics from Walmart and Target and cheap plastics from Rubbermaid are their competition, and on top of all that, other MLMs gave their sales model a bad name."
Tupperware is bankrupt lol
"Cutco has sorta gotten a little into that side of things, at least. I see them running a stand at Costco a couple times a year."
"Tupperware just filed bankruptcy and the local distributor is sending out scam orders, funny enough."
People still do the odd Tupperware Party here in Australia. I went to one around eight years ago.
I saw Cutco at my Costco. Now that's where you should be selling $1000 knives.
"They are good, the neighbor kid was selling them (they get commission or something) and the scissors cut a penny in half. I thought it was cool but only ever cut paper so I passed on that."
"Hah ha. You do know that cutting paper is one of the most dulling things you can do with scissors, right?

(Yes, I can still do the penny trick.)"
"My wife and i bought ourselves a 21 piece set for our wedding, absolutely zero regrets. 

10 years later they still perform great, i touch them up every 6 months or so."
"The last time I bought a knife set was 21 years ago and they cost me the equivalent of around $30 tiday. They're still working great. Hopefully you paid about the same price otherwise you're the prime example why these scams still exist:


Because people are dumb and advertise their stupidity, which gets other dumb people to do the same ..."
Nice try paid cutco shill...
They’re actually really good hahaha.
"Almost lost my thumb cutting a cabbage In half

Not a shill"
"You cut toward yourself? For shame!

But seriously, a Cutco demonstration and the warnings which come with it is probably the only knife safety instruction most people ever get nowadays. Unless they were in Scouts or an equivalent youth militia."
Yep I have four steak knives and finally after 30 years they need to be sharpened.
My mother sent some back a few years ago to be sharpened. They also replaced a few of the handles for no charge and without asking. They just treated it as a part of the maintenance of sharpening.
"My pops bought the deer gutting knife and it flew through bone so easily. I bought the steak knife, paring knife, and the carver as well as the scissors. Fucking phenomenal, also they will re sharpen for free."
"I was pitched Cutco once, and the guy cut a penny with the poultry shears."
"The overpriced kitchen good store near me sharpens for 75c an inch and 48 hour turnaround (I.e probably places that do it cheaper, faster, and better). I know I won't be sending knives somewhere to be sharpened - probably a 4-6 week turnaround. All that to say, free sharpening isn't really a great benefit, let alone one to make you go Cutco over another likely better, cheaper brand."
The meat department at my local grocery store will sharpen three knives per visit for free.  I brought in a machete as a joke once.  They sharpened it to the point that I shouldn't have been allowed to walk through the store with it afterward.
"Well shoot, I wonder if any do that around me..."
My dad still has the ones he bought in the 70s.
"No they're absolutely not, they're cheap steel and serrated so they stay sharper a little longer, but you'd be way better off buying a Victorinox set and a sharpening stone for less than half the price."
I’ll check them out.
They are not. You just never tried good knives.
Definitely down for recommendations if you have them!
Victorinox.  Their kitchen stuff is tremendous for the price.
"In the budget range nothing beats Dao Vau knives. I have a collection of around 30 knives ranging from 5 dollar to 1,500 dollar and was blown away with their performance.  They are so good I imported 50 of them for gift and to sell to friends and family. Then one of my friends were so blown away that we imported a 150 more together and sold them all in 2 weeks during Christmas(I dont recommend selling so many knives in such a short time with no retail experience). They are not rustresistant so they require some care like not leaving them wet, but after they get patina they are quite resistant."
This is just Cutco with extra steps lol.
If you think they are the same as Cutco you simply dont know knives.
"I'm saying what you are doing is.


Youre saying cutco are objectively terrible knives in a thread about MLM being bad while essentially doing what they do:


Buy a fuck ton of knives and sell to family, then get your friends to do it with you, too. 


The difference, in your mind, is your knives aren't shit."
"I didnt make any money off it, never intended to make any money. I bought them because I wanted my friends share my enthusiasm in these knives as they are amazing and will change how you view prepwork.

I only helped my friend make some money as he wanted to do it and it was fun doing it together. My daily job as a lawyer makes it completely irrational to ever try to make money of selling stuff as I make a month profit selling knives in a few days at my office.

I know the owner of the most successful knife shop in my country pretty well. i make 3 times his salary. if I ever sold knives to make money I would be stupid"
"I used to be a commercial chef, we paid a guy to come and sharpen our $300 kitchen knives every other week (he would actually just swap them out and then sharpen the ones we had) and then just rotate. So we always had really good knives.

I was still impressed with Cutco's quality. I don't know why they just don't sell them in stores, their business model is so archaic."
the knife business is very cutthroat
"Their scissors are absolutely elite. 

They can cut a penny!"
Great kitchen shears!  Cut a chicken in half or use it to cup a toddler's food right in the bowl.
"Similarly, one of my classmates decided to start her own 'branch' where they were the boss and recruited a whole bunch of underlings. She basically hire anyone who replied to her job posting and spent time training them bc I believe she pockets the upfront fee.

Long story short it lasted a couple of months and she stopped doing Vector."
"My university boyfriend sold those, and the were good knives! My parents bought a couple, but that was decades ago and I have no idea whatever happened to them. The knives, that is - I know where my parents are."
"lol.  how is that not a great business model?  would you have bought the knives from the person who recruited her?  no, but you did buy them from their proxy (your friend).  it's genius!"
Yeah buddy gave me a filet knife from them for my birthday in like 05. It's cleaned every fish I've caught since then.
"Tbh the one piece of theirs I actually do love and will fight for is that damn can opener.  It’s super comfy to hold, the crank is nice and fat which makes it easy to turn, and the magnet in the tip is a godsend for opening cans of sticky shit I don’t wanna risk touching.   

Seriously can that company please just sign a deal with Williams Sonoma or something so we can buy the decent pieces in a store"
"Everyone would either buy the cheapest Chinese knives in Target or the most expensive German knives at the mall, back in the 00’s. Now they just Sort By Price or Sort By Featured on Amazon.

Cutco is none of these, so they’re finding their market niche in the most efficient way: having college dropouts with no social skills bug their moms’ friends."
You should really try actually good knives. Cutco knives are 5 dollar knives and terrible on all factors.
"Glad to see someone with sense here lmao. They are garbage. It's insane how many Redditors, even just in this comment thread have fell for their bs."
the amount of pressure I've seen their salespeople apply during a sale is intense.  I had to block the phone number of the salesperson stalking me.
"same with Kirby vacuums.  

back before we got these super light, cordless, collapsible things they were the tips for an all-in-one unit.  heavy as fuck but could do everything you wanted, even curtains.

can't buy one in a store even though it is the best of its class."
It works!
"I didn't realize cutco was an mlm, I bought mine at a pop-up in Costco. It makes sense though. I had seen the booth a few different times before I bought any, and the sales person always had this old cutco knife that their grandma bought in the 70s, and it still cut so well. Its crazy that three different salespeople all had grandmas that bought the exact same knife and passed it down to them /s"
"Same. I got suckered into trying to sell those around 2002/2003...and I still have my set, use them daily. The knives are awesome. How they sell them, is what's a scam."
how do they sell them? o:
"They have you buy your demo set from them for a reduced price. The demo set is not their full set, but the essential pieces. And they tell you that when you stop selling Cutco, you can either 1) keep them fpr personal use, or 2) can sell them, but not for less than you bought them for. 

Then, to sell...they have you set up a ""no strings"" expected sales pitches to friends and family. And after you have demoed the knives to these friends and family...perhaps sold them some...you ask the friends and family for people they know that you can set up more demos for. And then you aak those people for more people you can do a demo for. And keep asking..."
Lmao that is annoying as hell.
"I felt it just made it awkward for everyone involved. Most didn't want to give leads, some felt guilted into it. But doing it this way, Cutco could promise you there were no ""cold calls"" in selling your knives."
"I had just moved back home from college and was looking for a job, answered one of those ""$14 an hour!"" sheets that were all over telephone poles back then.  Got hired in and they didn't even tell us what it was for until the first day of training.  When they got to the point where they told us we had to buy the demo set before we could start selling I literally laughed out loud, got up and walked out.  Pre internet days were crazy."
"Just curious how this is different than tupperware parties, which has generally been viewed as a legitimate business (hasn't it?)

(Yes, I'm aware they have finally succumbed to the market, but they were successful for decades)."
I was able to return my demo set no problem.
"They get teens to go around and give presentations pushing them on people, advertising a deceptively high hourly pay (that they aren't likely to get unless they sell very effectively and doesn't include some things like the fact that the kids have to buy their own demo set). The sales technique kinds of relies on people guilt-buying knives to help out their friends' kids."
"Essentially, they target people in relatively unstable financial situations and pull some tricks that tries to make them pay for the knives if they are unable to sell."
"They are not awesome, you just never tried using a good knife."
"I have a ton of good knives. Cutco stands the test of time, and quality service (life time guarantee). I'd like to know why you think they are not good. 

Also made in America if you care about that at all."
"What good knives do you have? Global and crap like that?

They are not good because they have a absolutely joke of a grind. Just a machined hollow grind with terrible thickness behind the edge making them cleavers instead of kitchen knives. 

Next the metal is below average and terrible for the price they charge. It is worse than a freaking IKEA knife. Also at 56-59 they are not very hard and will dull fast.

The price for their knives are just INSANE as you can get very good japanese knives with high end steel, handmade and proper grind for the same price as those super marked quality knives. Only someone with no knowledge of knives would ever think they are worth their price. Maybe if you can get one for 10 dollar at flea marked.  

  
\> Also made in America if you care about that at all.

So you confirm it is crap?"
"Just a heads up, try being less snarky and condescending and people might want to have conversations on the topic. People would be more open to discussing the topic as opposed to arguing with a random over the internet."
You are right. Just annoys me that people with no knowledge about a subject gives bad advice on it. like a guy giving car advice  having only driven a 1988 Trabant thinking they are good cars
Elaborate please. I'm genuinely curious
"I never got as far as selling and ended up turning in my sales kit for a refund and quitting (mostly I refused to use friends/family for my first calls and they got very frustrated with me so I changed my mind), but for a brief time I did have the knife set in my car.  During this time I got locked out of my house and ended up using one of the knives to pry open a window and climb into my house.  It worked really well for that."
"Same. My favorite knife is a small serrated knife and it’s amazing. My family had a whole set we bought from a family friend and those were the special good knives. There was a spatula one with a serrated edge and a smooth edge that my dad treated like another child, it was so precious to him."
I find them at thrift stores and have a whole set. Love them!
And you can get them resharpened for free still!
and you can send them back to get sharpened for free!
"I feel the same about pampered chef/tupperware. Hate the fucking business model, but they truly are great products with amazing warranties."
"Yes!! My god, do I love Tupperware products"
Oh hell yeah!!
"Back in the late 90's right after gradating high school I got an interview at some office for some job. No details on the job or requirements. It ended up being a Cutco marketing recruiting thing.

I've never taken another interview invite by mail again."
My mom felt bad for a kid who was selling those like 30 years ago and bought a few.  She still uses them.
Didn't OJ have a complete set?
"I went to the Cutco factory in Olean, NY to buy a set -- they're that good. 

But the sales & marketing schtick they used to do.... Yeah, that was scammy."
literally so good lol
"I’ve heard of cutco, but I’ve never really been exposed to it. What’s the scam, or is it just an MLM?"
"The whole business model is advertising a “No experience necessary” sales job, selling a demonstration set to your employee, maybe they sell a set or two to some relatives before quitting, repeat with new employee.

They’ve been doing the same thing for more than 50 years! (My dad sold a few sets post college)"
It’s an MLM where you sell knives. Seriously.
"Yea, that’s kinda what I figured. MLMs in general are such giant scams."
"An MLM, and they're shitty knives."
"Dumb college kids who are too lazy to get a real summer job get sold on it. They spend the summer trying to sell knife sets to their friends & family. They’re average quality and overpriced.

People often buy them out of guilt because the kid selling them is an idiot."
"I mean, they’re ok quality. You could get wostofs for cheaper"
"Wusthofs are SO much better it's not even close.

Cutco are not great knives at all."
"It’s not even a scam to sell. They’re just predatory as fuck. 

Scam would imply the knives suck, which they absolutely do not."
My dad bought a set almost 20 years years only because one of his friend's son was selling and my dad would buy if he found absolutely other job
Agreed
Had mine since 2004.
"My son got recruited to sell those, and we bought some. They are amazing, but he quickly realized their business practices amounted to a pyramid scheme- and it wasn’t the kids selling that made money."
They are! I own a few.
"They're lower-mid tier knives at high tier prices       
My parents got me a set for my wedding, and I upgraded to Wusthof and the experience is night and day"
">but damn those are good knives.

They're *ok*, not good, and terribly terribly overpriced for the quality. The steel is basically ""the minimum acceptable quality"" for a kitchen knife and for the amount they charge, I'd rather have a stamped knife with better steel at 1/5th of the price with a more comfortable handle."
"Yep!  

It's not an MLM, because you get paid on what you sell, and usually don't get a piece of who you recruit. 

But it is a shitty sales job.  

The real irony?  Is that I recall they still pay a minimum wage for appointments, which is much better than commission only sales jobs.  It's actually 'far from the worst'."
Okay but I had a friend that worked there that gave me a knife as a gift… BEST knife I have maybe there’s something to it…😂😂
If you compare them to a piece of soft plywood they could be considered good. They are not good they are so incredibly bad.
I sold my mom a set of Cutco knives over 30+ years ago and they are as good today as they were then.
"My brother got sucked into that program. He sold to his family and then his friends. After that, there was no one else to sell to and then he quit. The knives are rather good, however."
I still have the $1000+ set I won while selling them and they are so good 😂 would never buy again but man they are good
My parents listened to a kid in our church selling cutco more out of being politeness and to give him practice...then he pulled out the scissors and cut a penny in front of them and they bought a set from him because they wanted those scissors
"Same with Kirby! The door to door sales is nonsense, but the vacuums are ah-mazing."
"They may be good, but they are insanely overpriced. There are plenty of brands that are cheaper and just as good if not better."
Still the best knive I've ever used. Even though it was like $100
They are only good knives for people who don't know how to keep real knives sharp.
Ok ok I’ll get off your lawn
"I won't convince the masses here, but I'll make my pitch anyway. 

Looking at basically all objective measures of performance at the price that cutco sells knives, they are inferior to similarly priced traditional knives.

Stamped blades     
Worse edge retention     
Less balanced     
Harder to sharpen at home     
Inferior metal     
Worse comfort in the hand     

Subjectively they also lose in the method of high pressure sales.    

The one area they perform objectively better than similarly priced knives is their warranty. If you're using them to cut into your tuna cans (like they demonstrate in the sales pitch) you'll definitely need that warranty at some point. If you use them like knives instead of can openers, screw drivers, or pry bars, it is unlikely you will ever use the warranty. 

Generally speaking, most knife sets are a tremendous waste of money. You're much better off buying a chef's knife, a boning/fillet style knife, a paring knife, and 4 steak knives, than you are filling out a block with knives you never touch. If you don't know how to sharpen knives, find someone local who does it. Won't cost much more than what cutco charges to send knives back and forth."
Umm… we get our Cutco knives sharpened for free
"My mom scours garage sales for any cutco now if she can find. She's found quite a few. Once she found an old set of wood handled steak knives that were falling apart. She went in to get sharpened, and they sent her brand new ones with nice poly handles. Free of course."
"Best knives ever! I have the butcher block set with 5 knives, scissors and steak knives that I bought from my nephew when he was in college 15 years ago. Then about 4 years ago my daughter asked for knives for Christmas, and they just happened to have a Costco booth, so I bought her a butcher block set for Christmas, a set of steak knives that I gave her for her birthday, and a set of three chopping knives for me. Use these knives daily, even take them on vacation because I hate not having good knives. I've been accused of being a knife snob lol"
They have damn good knives so I don’t need to buy any more! Stop calling and sending me mail Micheal!!!!
"I have a set. I also have really good knives.

Cutco steak knives are decent. Serrated knives are okay. Chef knife is shit and doesn’t hold an edge. Bread knife has a great shape and length -I wish it were better…"
Sometimes they have a guy demonstrating and selling them at Costco
"Hell, they're selling them at Costco! :o"
Don't they sell at Costco?
"I mean, they’re okay as far as knives go. It’s not actually that hard to make serviceable knife -  there’s a youtube video of a guy making a sharp kitchen knife out of noodles or something - it’s hard to make something affordable that retains its edge well for a long time. Cutco knives dull relatively quickly and are overpriced for what you get. Global, Zwilling, and Victorinox all make better knives for the same or lower prices."
"Right? I wish you could just buy them at a STORE like a fucking normal business. I don't wanna go looking for some random college kid to buy a knife off of. I don't understand how that business model even works. I actually worked for cutco, never had to pay them a dime for anything, but made about $100 doing those silly presentations for my friend's parents who I knew would never buy one but would give me 45 minutes of their time."
"They really are.  My mom bought a set 30-ish years ago, and still has em."
That's what I was gonna say
"Cutco, yes. They are one of the only pyramid schemes with an actually quality product though. The knives are incredibly durable, and they have what is essentially a lifetime warranty. My parents bought some from one of their friends kid, they’ve had them for like 20 years now."
"Honestly a bit of a shame when a quality product is wrapped up in being a pyramid scheme. I feel the same way about Advocare, which have an awful rap for their sales practice and a lot of their ""weight loss"" products, but they also make one of the only healthy energy drink alternatives I actually like drinking."
"I replied to another person my story of my mom buying a Cutco slotted spoon in the 90's from my babysitter's boyfriend. She still has it to this day. And my older lady neighbor has friends who sell Amway products and she ""signed up"" but just buys stuff for herself since a decent amount of the personal care products are good and good to give as gifts.

If you know you're not going to make a career, or even beer money, off of it, all MLM products aren't bad even if their business practices are deplorable."
"Is it really a pyramid scheme? From what I understand you don't recruit other sellers as your ""downstream"" or whatever, there aren't layers of people above getting a piece of your sales, and you don't have to buy the product yourself. Seems like they are a direct sales company with an overpriced product and predatory tactics to recruit sales people that will be severely underpaid. Absolute scum bags, yes. Different type of scum than what I'd call a pyramid schemes though."
"I work for CUTCO and you do recruit people. I got in from my friend and in the interview you basically give them three more people to interview. It’s also always automatic hire. I only got more money for sales but obviously the rest of the money was going somewhere. 
It is true you don’t have to buy your stuff. You can though. I wish I had the money too."
"Do you get anything from the people you recruit though? That's what the downstream bullshit is that makes something a pyramid scheme. You get a cut of your recruits sales, and a cut of sales from who they recruit and so on."
That depends if you are running a local office or not. They have other divisions that are not what they call door to door sales.
"I dated someone in Cutco for a long time. Everyone is talking about the local offices as opposed to their other divisions. She mainly worked for the events team, so she would go to conventions, markets, etc. The girl made really good money (about 85k/year) and did absolutely no recruiting or downstream BS. However, she did have a boss in the area that basically did fuck all and just made a percentage from her which was a bit dumb. They also got to go on full-paid vacations maybe 5 times a year. Received tons of gifts (Rolex, gold ruby encrusted ring). 

The only thing I had a problem with was it essentially became a cult in that area of the company. All of her friends and people she would hang out with was nothing but Cutco or Vector marketing people."
"Back in the day the MLMs like many other consumer products used to have quality, Cutco, Avon, Mary Kay.  Newer ones just sell junk."
"Tupperware too I guess, although they got out of the MLM game a while ago"
"Pampered Chef stuff is decent as well.  I have a few pieces I've bought through garage sales and eBay, very happy with the quality."
"Cutco? I don't know about what's involved in selling them, but they're great knives.  Still using the one I got in 1976."
"When you start ""working"" for them, not only do you have to attend motivation meetings for 2 days without them paying you but you also have to front the money for the demonstration set you will be using to try and convince your family and friends to buy that shit. They might be good knives but they operate like scammers."
They were trying to convince college kids they could make $15/hr in 2005 lol.
I just think of Frank Reynolds selling knives
Pretend this shoe is an unboned chicken
CUTCO!! They tried to recruit me when I was young and dumb. Thank god for my friend Joe!!
"Lol I worked for them!

I actually did fairly well.  Technically not a scam but they’re overpriced and a large portion of the cost of the knives goes to the salesperson."
"I'm embarrassed to say I tried to sell knives when I was 19. Utter failure.

The good thing was I met a brazilian chick there who was down for whatever. And I do mean *whatever* 😏"
No shit cutco was at costco today (south fl)  i almost fell for it back in college they get you good.
https://youtu.be/ElEIUtzCG7c?si=bvoMXUsgSEd1nYDm
Cutco? I sold those senior year of high school. Sliced my thumb pretty good while demonstrating but still have a couple knives and a serving spoon 33 years later.
"They’re overpriced, no question. But my parents have had a set of CUTCO knives for almost 20 years. Those bastards still cut great."
The cutco scissors are where it’s at. Worth every penny. My mom has had hers probably close to 20 years and they still work fantastically. When cutco was at Costco this summer I scoured the internet for better kitchen scissors in the price range. General consensus was the knives while good you can get better for about the same but the scissors couldn’t be beat.
Ginzu?
Yes! The owner of the company I used to work for was so excited because the “sales trainer” he paid 40k to train us for one day sent him a cutco knife as a thank you gift!
"I still own a couple of them. They were gifts, lol."
Those Vaccum salesman too!
"A friend of one of my kids was doing that garbage and wanted me to do the appointment. I told him I would give him $20 to NOT to come to my house. He took me up on it, probably the most he made the whole time."
Oh vector and cutco knifes they are good knifes I still have a set but very scammy and relied on people's family and friends to make sales
I do have a Ginsu knife I got 35 years ago and it works a treat.
My job once! I did that. Shake hands with Cutco!
"As a matter of fact...yes I had to stop my girlfriend recently from purchasing a new knife set when we have one with more knives of better quality 
Perhaps I should be worried about her interest in sharp metals"
"Vector, wasn't it?"
Vector Marketing which exclusively sells CUTCO knives.
"Cutco. They target kids just out of high school/community colleges. It's Vector Marketing over the phone. They won't say their name on the phone when they call to schedule an interview you never asked for.

Had someone I had gone to high school with ""refer"" me to them, because they demand phone numbers, and we had worked on one group project in like 11th grade so he had my number."
"Cutco, it’s still around"
"Ooh, Cutco/Vector Marketing. I've heard of those guys."
"I was looking up recipes recently and only on my second visit to one recipe page did I realize I was getting it off Cutco's website. I guess it's not the end of the world and I'm sure the recipe was fine, but...ew. It felt slimy."
cutco?? YES. My wife and I got an ad for a remote job from them (it obvi wasn’t labeled “cutco”) for broke college students (which we are). Got to scheduling the interview and realized that it was cutco. I see those mfs in costco too
I had one of those jobs for 2 days. When they told me to bring a check for a set of knives the next day I never went back.
"My dad fell into the Cutco trap about 15 years ago. He still has a huge set of those damn things and I hate them. They are some of the worst balanced knives I've ever used, and the santoku knife I bought from a Goodwill for 50¢ holds a better edge for longer. The knife sharpener they gave to sellers kicks ass though, it's genuinely a good product."
"Someone I went to high school with targeted me with the knife set scam. She tried to get me to have a FaceTime meeting with her to discuss buying them and told me the prices were ""eye-watering,"" but they were good knives. First of all, the cost of anything has never once made my eyes water and I hate that dumb phrase, and second, I have a good set of knives, so why the hell would I need another one. I ended up blocking her because she wouldn't leave me alone about them."
I still use my demo set from when they tried to get me. I realized it was a scam after they shorted me on my first check lol.
My grandpa bought these for my parents and they lasted over a decade
Haven't tried em but I've heard the knives are actually good.
"our local supermarkets are now giving them as ""prizes"" if you collect tons of stickers that you get each 10 or so dollars on your reciept, except the stickers don't even give you the knifes, only 50% discount on them."
"OMG one of our local ""politicians"" was running for a seat and BRAGGED about being in Cutco as a top sales representative...  He did not win thank god."
"It slices. it dices.

Look at that tomato!

You could even cut a tin can with it,

But you wouldn't want to!"
My college bf worked in Cutco for years. He ended up broke asking me for gas money and then dropping out of college. He defended Cutco up and down through all of this but couldn’t answer where his money was going. I have no idea if he made any money off of it. But my parents helped him out at the beginning and bought me a set of knives. I can’t stand the man but I still had the knives.
My parents have had theirs for 25 years - I’ve had mine for 15! Maybe they’re too good - it seems like they never need to be replaced haha
"My mother-in-law bought a set of those and when she passed we ended up with the knives.

They were great knives until my kids took them out to the forest and lost them. I’m still mad my wife’s mother-in-law didn’t watch them worth a crap that day."
"Omg trying to tell fellow college students this was a scam was always met with great anger 🤣 that Vector ""Marketing Group"" targets dumb young people."
my cousin had a brief stint as a cutco salesman back in the early 2010s lmaooooo
"You mean Cutco?

Yes, they're very much still around"
Lol i still have the free spiralizer (that does actually work pretty well) from a demo 10 years ago
"I worked for them for a summer between college semesters.

I wouldn't call it a scam to work for them. Everything is laid out plain and simple because they want even the dumbest people to be able to move the product.

One lame part though was I got in trouble for selling to multiple people at once. The session took longer, so it wasn't like I was faking the time I put in and ""stealing"" from the company. Turns out when you get multiple households in the same room, they will instigate each other to buy more stuff. I did more sales in 2 nights of doing presentations that way than I had the 3 weeks prior. They were also more forthcoming with contact info of people to hit up next.

I quit after that though. One thing at jobs I have never been able to stand is being forced to do things inefficiently because ""that's just the way."""
"I just commented on a different post. I got sucked into the cutco experience in high school. It was horrible and awkward for everyone involved. I'm an introverted, awkward girl. Anyway. Got my demo kit (don't remember how much that bad boy cost me) and lasted about 2 weeks before my anxiety became too much.

However, the knives are very good and I still have my set. So at least they are good products. I just had to send my paring knife out to be repaired, and it's like 20 years old"
"I still feel bad for all the people I sold those knives to, not because of the product, but because of the sales tactics and markup. Surprisingly, my mom still has some of the knives, and almost 20 years later, they're still going strong.

I ended up dmropping out of that ""job"" after I went to one of their regional rallies/sales conferences and heard every single speaker get on stage and tell the audience to lie in order to sell more knives. I think the justification was, ""Take anyone else's story, pretend like it's your personal experience, and fake it till you make it."""
"The first MLM i attended. Sounded fishy, looked them up online, and saw every link talk about how they are a scam. Vector/Cutco, I believe"
"I was working a shitty back breaking job when I got referred to some sort of “sales position” by a colleague. I showed up for the interview, it was a knife set company, and by the third slide they had dedicated to “we’re not a pyramid scheme” I said “this is a pyramid scheme”. Thank god they were so shit at hiding it, cause I would’ve done almost anything to quit the job I was working"
"God, it was a rite of passage in undergrad to get suckered into meeting their reps once and then bounce because it's a scam. Almost 30 years later, they still paper college campuses with flyers and even write shit on chalkboards in empty classrooms."
Cutco knifes are top tier though!
"Ah yes, Cutco knives. Worked for them in 1999. I hated the work, but damn, those knives are awesome. So good, I have a few now. The business model is so scammy. But at least what people are getting is a great product that you will use almost daily."
A couple of years ago someone sold a knife to my fiancé’s mom.
"If you are talking about Cutco, those are legitimate awesome knives and the lifetime warranty is legit.  Source: My parents bought them in 1982 and still have them"
"I bought this ridiculous looking ‘as seen on TV’ knife from a cheap shop for under $5. Turns out it’s a pretty good knife😂 but those damn infomercials! Doesn’t matter what they’re selling, I’ll be glued to the TV (not sucked in enough to buy from the TV though, I don’t need 4 sets of whatever for one easy payment). My favourite right now is ‘The Nibbler’ that cuts through ANY metal with ease. I don’t need one, I’m not gunna buy one, but I’m *impressed*😂"
"Cutco! My wife sold those in college at Madison around 1990. Well, she sold a knife or two. She didn’t last very long. We still have the ones she purchased. They are great knives. We send them in around every other year for free sharpening and they replace some of them for even the slightest bit of normal wear and tear. Our daughter is at university now and received an inquiry about a job with Vector Marketing. We had a fun time explaining what she was looking into."
i hate to say it but... those knives slap.
"Ha! I bought 2 knives from my daughters friend, knew about the MLM aspect of it, but they're good knives and I wanted to give the girl a chance to give her pitch and make a little commish. 

First time using one, sliced halfway through my thumb. 

Went to the ER with bloody towels around my thumb and said ""just got a new knife"" 

The triage nurse said ""Cutco?""

Yep. 

8 stiches."
Welcome to Cutco
"My ex sold that, he got sales from my family (we were teens and it was his first job) but not a lot elsewhere lol"
I instantly thought about miracle blade 3. i always wanted that knive set as a kid. the way they cut through a pineapple mid air was just freakin awesome and chef toni also played his part...
"My daughter's friend, just out of high school, headed to college, almost got suckered into it.  Luckily, he got wise and bailed.  Cutco is unfortunately alive and well."
Yes. I know someone from a different state who got into that and tried “recruiting” one of my coworkers recently.

"Friend of mine came over one day with his partner to talk to me and mine at the time about an exciting new business opportunity. He seemed like he'd rehearsed the spiel loads, he was confident in what he was selling. And half way through I was like ""nope. Sorry man I'm going to cut you short, we are not interested. I have seen my mum go through too many of those and missed too many meals because of it to be involved with them. Good luck with it and all, but it's not for us."" Didn't give him a chance to come back to it."
"Like Pampered Chef has some legit stuff, if you didn't have to order it through the MLM structure or for the marked up price the non-MLM sources charge.

Wanna shut down an Amway spiel? ""Sorry, we worship at the church of Costco and aren't interested in converting."""
My parents one time agreed to host one so they could get this really fancy serving spoon for free. They conveniently lost the number of the person they were supposed to set it up with and when they'd get calls about it they said wrong number lol. Scam the scam for a free spoon.
Didn't Lululemon and Scentsy start out as MLMs?
You're thinking LuLaRoe and Scentsy is still an MLM
"Tupper parties are the OG, the difference being that they actually sold useful stuff. But the principle has always rubbed me the wrong way."
"Yeah, I wasn't defensive MLMs, just thought it was relevant to the papers chef comment. Looks like a few people took that as me saying that MLMs are a legitimate business, or maybe the down votes are because I confused Lululemon with Lularoe."
The word NO is a complete answer. I'd add FUCK OFF if they don't get the gist.
"""are you gonna to walk away from financial freedom?"""
"Because I was a decent looking guy, have the gift of gab, and am very personable; I got targeted all the time by MLM people. The number of times Amway people bought me lunch or dinner... they never ate. I am assuming because they could not afford to buy my lunch AND for themselves as well. 

I would always ask them 1) How long have you been a part of this? and 2) How much money have you made?

They always said the same thing, 1) Well, I just got into it recently, and I immediately thought of you. 2) We really arent allowed to talk about how much we have made.

Then I would say, ""BULLSHIT! You have sent the last 20 minutes telling me how much all of these diamonds and whatever have made. About how Sammy Somebitch started last year and is now making $250k/year. You can talk about how much these FEW successful people have made, but not yourself.""

That was when they realized they just bought an asshole who would call them out, a free meal. I was decent enough to leave the tip, and made sure the servers saw it. Just in case they tried to steal the tip from them. 

Seriously, in a 4 or 5 year period of the mid 90s, I got about 15 to 20 free meals a year from these people. I was rakish enough to sleep with a few of the women that were trying to get me into it. But I told them I wasnt interested in the MLM BS first."
MlMs almost killed my relationship with my mom.
"My college friend took me to a coffee shop one day only to be ganged up by a team of pyramid sellers. They talked big about making a lot of money but when they didn't even offer to buy me a coffee (even though the waiter asked), I knew they had to be lying."
"Same back in high school. It just smells fishy all around the moment you step in. It wasn't even an event hall or meeting room. It was just someone's living room. After the event, I was honest with him and told him it smelled like a scam, but he still went for it. Didn't even last half a year there, and he lost a few hundred dollars for the starting kit. Idk how people even fall for that crap when it was just screaming red flags."
"As unemployed I reached out to my network to see if someone knew something. 
A lady at the outskirts had a thing. 
So she took me to a meeting.

Some Salesbitch of a woman talking about how the leader was such a good guy. And the bitch was talking about how her dad was so suspicious but after talking to the leader, her dad was convinced!!! And her dad was here and he was some sort of hot shot.

I. Was. Fuming. 
I could be out in the soul-sucking world of geting a job. A paying job. A real job!
MLM force you to buy stuff. It is not based on customer demand! I hated this.

I just wanted to drag the woman who got me there out. Bit she was all ""I want that corner-office!""

I wanted to scream at the Salesbitch. Do I look like I care about you, your dads opinion or want to pay to work?!?

Yes... I'm still pissed.

On the other hand I once got a hold of some really good products from MLM. I still don't get why those just don't do normal sales. The products were solid.
Needkess say, no did not join that either."
"Oh man, I had one of those. I got a call asking if I was still looking for a job. Got the company name, general job description, I said yeah sure, ill go check it out. Huh, a paint company? Dont know much about paint, but I guess? Turns out, nope. They were in the basement area of the paint store building, running a ""financial advisory"" business. Was just a taaaad suspicious how much they kept emphasising that you should only think of how much money you would be making with this job, and by the way, your pay will always be two months late due to national bank rules. Needless to say, I am still not driving a Ferrari. Xd

OVB, in case anyone still thinks of doing business with/working with them... if they still exist anyway."
"That's unfortunately a very good audience for this type of a scam. A lot of them have done crap jobs and had to endure with shitty bosses and horrible customers. Then the idea of 'be your own boss!' is dangled before them, with pictures of mercedes benzes and exotic holidays they can have when they sign up for this surefire way to make insane money. Naturally no one's asking howcome more people aren't doing it if it was supposedly so well paid."
"I was invited to one. I came prepared with a list of pre-googled info on the company and put the asshole on blast (after the free meal that was promised, of course). Still sad to see that there were several old people falling for the scam, despite me literally telling the sales critter that they were lying about this ""150 year of German noble pedigree"" the company had, when it was in fact founded 15 years ago in the Netherlands. Didn't matter, still granny felt the mattress was a good deal for them."
"The summer of my freshman year of college I was looking for a job and went to a group interview for what turned out to be Cutco Knives. I hadn't heard of them before and spent 20min listening to the pitch. Once I realized what was up I told the 6 other people in the interview what their deal was and that it was a scam. Everyone, save one guy got up and left.

I had nothing better going on so I hung out outside the storefront the interviews were taking place in and explained to every person why it was a scam and that they would charge you $100+ just to buy a set of the knives that you would use to try to scam other people. I got at least 5-6 more people to turn around. After about 1.5hrs the guy that did the first interview came out and told me I pissed off his boss (apparently one of the people I tried to talk sense into) and he gave me $100 to go away lol."
"A few friends and I went to an Amway thing while we were in college. The way they sell it to you, makes it sound appealing, but the reality is that some crazy number like 96% of people that get involved don’t even break even. Called my mom about this “new opportunity” of me making money and she basically was like don’t be stupid and don’t get involved. I’m so thankful I listened to her."
"lol my ex father in law wanted me to get involved in his gold MLM.  
the gist of it was you buy a gram and then resell it.. 

i was oh! that sounds really interesting..  are you selling it for spot? or is it a little higher? 

he goes 
>whats spot?

i then informed him i was not interested. If his documentation didnt even include a primer on what spot was, then it was a scam. 

for the viewers at home. ""spot"" is the current selling price of a precious metal.

"When I was going through training at Great Lakes Naval Training Center, there was always a bunch of ""jam"" vans outside the side gate waiting to pick people up. Mostly to take groups of sailors to Gurnee Mills. One time, there was a different van from some financial institution. They were collecting groups of people who were interested in going to their office to talk about annuities. To be honest, the only reason I went was because I was bored and they promised free donuts."
"About 15 years ago I had two different people call me around the same time about a pyramid scheme that involved buying crap in bulk..   (within a few weeks of each other) and I declined both of them and said it wasn't for me.  I was single at the time why would I need huge boxes of cereal and toilet paper . Plus it was all off brand stuff (which some things you can get away with but some I just can't do the off brand)

Anyway a few weeks later I saw an ad somewhere about making extra money part time, it was vague but I figured I'd look into it.   I met with some lady to discuss at a coffee shop after work,  and she said there was a big meeting they were going to in like 1/2 hour at a local hotel to discuss more details.  

Still super vague I really I had no idea what was going on but figured I didn't have anywhere else to be so I agreed to go.

So I get to this big meeting and as soon as I walk in I see BOTH of the people trying to recruit me earlier and I immediately knew what it was before the presentation started.. of course the presentation was what it was since I already heard the schtick from both of the other people before.  I guess it was even more detail in what I had already heard before .   But yeah I should have just walked out as soon as I saw them but did stick around for the presentation before declining and leaving.."
"Man, my mom got caught up in an Avon selling one when I was a kid. There would be tons of boxes of unsold Avon products all around the house. 20 years later, I was so frustrated to see her caught up in Amway"
"I was 18, going to college downtown in Chicago, and I was taking a bus to platos closet with a hamper of clothes to hopefully sell for some extra cash. 

Grown ass man sits next to me and starts acting like we're great friends, and he wants me to work for him. I can meet him at the gyro place at 8 and we can talk about it and he'll buy me dinner. Cool!

Knowledge of MLMs wasn't even close to as common and widespread as it is today, but it was out there for sure.

I personally didn't have a ton of knowledge about MLMs, but I was raised in an environment where I learned at a young age that if it sounds too good to be true, it is. 

Oh boy, was it obviously some bullshit.. can't remember which one it was, but I clocked him SO fast. I kept playing along, though, because I was hungry, and it was fascinating to me that he thought I wasn't seeing right through him. 

When he finished, I asked him if he was really ignorant enough to believe everything he just told me, or if he was trying to prey on a desperate college student. I said it nicely and offered to explain to him how he was being scammed if he truly believed the stuff he had just said to me. 

Framed it as if I cared for his well-being and didn't want him to continue to be scammed, but we both knew. 

He called ME an asshole! Woah there! Sorry I didn't let you scam me lol

I did get a free gyro and fries tho"
"The lure of free money gets bites across the income scale:

I had one of my buddies from law school try to recruit me into an Amway scheme.  Had clearly been coached by some other shmuck with a whole shpiel about gold bars and heart-felt desires.  Even had some half-assed modern twist about using the internet to cut out the middle-man.

I told him to send me the link and that I'd buy something if there were actual bargains to be had.  But I wasn't going to go round recruiting anyone to funnel money up the chain.

I was honestly kind of shocked he was dumb enough to fall for it in the first place, but there you go."
"I once saw my aunt nearly get into what I'm pretty sure was a straight up Ponzi scheme, not even an MLM (I say 'pretty sure' because it was years back and I didn't even know about Ponzi/pyramid schemes then, just thought the logic of it was off). And she wasn't stupid or greedy! but it was sold to her as some kind of solidarity thing, like a, idk, mutual aid fund or mutual credit thing... Nefarious stuff."
"I'll pile on to tell my story too:

Fresh out of college, I was looking for work. I got invited to come interview for a manager position. I had some supervisor experience, so it sounded good. I went to an office park nearby, and reception led me into a conference room. I said there may be a mistake, I'm here to meet with Mr. Blahblah. They said yes, Mr. Blahblah is leading the presentation.

I realized pretty quickly this was a MLM scheme. Everyone in the audience was so enthusiastic and into it. I was just getting a real creepy vibe, so I stood up and started to walk out. The host asked where I was going, the presentation just started. I just said it's not for me, thanks anyway.

I was sitting in my car and called my friend to tell him how bonkers this was. Just a minute later all the ""audience"" came out the front door. I realized they were all acting, and I was the target all along."
"“Contractors” that show up to your door unsolicited telling you they’ll do work on your house for super cheap. *Especially* those “working in the area.”

Do your homework on anyone working on your house. Make sure they’re licensed, insured, permitted to work in your state etc."
"In the tri-state area i forget if it was Z100 or another radio station, but they would find people scammed by these contractors and get a warrant issued against them call them on live radio for a job then threaten to take them to court unless they repaired and completed the job for the person scammed as well as gave them their original deposit back. They would often agree and followup because it meant them serving serious jail time as well as loosing their trades license on top of legal fees as well."
"I hate to break it to you, but you got scammed listening to this.  The laws for radio changed decades ago, and ever since then, a radio station needs your permission to play your voice and any recordings of your voice on the air.

They can't call and pretend to be someone else.  Legally, they have to tell you immediately that you are  live on the air with a radio station.

So, all of those calls were fake.  They usually use interns or off air employees that want to have a little fun.  The same goes for all the ""prank"" calls they do, and the relationship ones, all of it.  None of them are real."
"next you'll tell us that those ""kiss cams"" that create iconic marketable moments at sports games aren't real either >:("
It's ok.  We'll always have the WWE when we want a dose of reality.
Which tri-state area? There are a lot of those.
"Best I got is Z100 is a New York station. NY, NJ andddd this is giving more PA (Philly) than CT hahah"
"There were also A LOT of Z and B every single number radio stations. Three popular ones were z&b 100, z&b 104 and z&b 94. It's the way that it rolls off the tongue. 

Yes, the first one that you get when you search is New York. But there's that main character syndrome again. If you insist that I need to know that that's New York, then you assume that I've lived anywhere near New York. There are lots of z100s all over the place and only people who believe they're the central figure in everybody else's narrative think that we should automatically know what they're talking about. 

Basically the people who argue with this have a self-centered personality, and the people who are going ""omg finally somebody said it,"" don't.  It doesn't mean anything, it's just that some people are more self-centered than others. This is a red flag when somebody automatically assumes that you should know what they're talking about when they use one of these colloquialisms and gets angry because you don't. And I mean that in the sense of I was a trained psych nurse and when somebody acts like this, it points towards a pathology.

 The difference between a pathology and just a dysfunctional form of communication is when you point it out to somebody, if they CAN'T correct it or stop doing it, or understand that it's even dysfunctional, that points to a pathology. Pathology means it's being caused by something that is medically wrong with them.  

But honestly, people don't know that they're doing it if you don't point it out to them. So you have to give them the chance to stop doing it by pointing it out."
"1. Seeing that you’re a trained in psychology, I would think that would you see the lack of “insistence” in my comment and the dash of humor there as well regarding Philadelphia. Maybe your comment is better served for r/psych ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

2. I live in California. Not even LA or SF. Along with those cities NYC is the main character and the population sizes and GDPs (+ Chicago) can tell you that.

3. You just said it’s the first one that comes up when you searched… I’m sorry that wherever you live is so overlooked that you feel the need to add psychoanalysis to innocuous comments."
I mean z100 has a studio in LA audience as well on top of an LA studio once iHeartRadio became a thing
"I have no idea what you're talking about because I don't listen to radio at all and I haven't since the '80s. I haven't used iHeart since before the pandemic. So people know what you're talking about if they listen to radio but if they don't, they have no idea what you're talking about. 

That's what I'm saying is dysfunctional- You're using gauges that not everybody uses and expecting us all to know what you're talking about. And you're up in here down voting everything and responding defensively. Feeling some kind of way, obviously. 

🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩"
The only red flag here is you writing essay length responses boomer maybe go get yourself checked in at the psych ward lmao
Imagine being offended because your version of Tri-state area doesn’t align with theirs 😹 this absolute kook (from the ~beautiful south~) is looking for things to be offended by
Thank you!!! I see people use “tri-state” on Reddit all the time and I’ve never once seen someone get called out on it.
"It's a particular sticking point for me as I am a military brat who then went in the military, and I've lived in around multiple different metro areas in the United States that referred to themselves on TV stations as the tri-state area. And I've never lived around New York & New Jersey. Plus, I love to road trip all over the US. I've driven across country seven times. I've been in a lot of hotels and turned on the television and heard the local news say ""the tri-state area.""

It's a colloquialism that's used on television and radio stations when three states come together and they serve that area. People assume that you mean New York because of its very dense population and New York being popular all over the world, so that's technically the most popular one. 

But I knew a girl in the military from I want to say it was Tennessee and she referred to ""going back to the tri-state area."" She acted like I was an idiot not knowing that she was talking about like Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia. I'm like honey, there's a lot of Tri-State areas. The one that you are from is not THE tri-state area.

  I was a psych nurse. I was trained in therapeutic communication.  I was taught to ask questions of people that force them to clarify statements in a way that makes them realize how dysfunctional or pathologic their communication is. It's a psych technique. This main character syndrome, where somebody assumes that everybody should know what they're talking about because they're the main character in everybody's story, is a thing that people with personality disorders do a lot.  A lot of perfectly healthy people do it too. I was just trained to point it out so that people realize they're doing it, and doing so in a non-threatening manner."
I've never heard the tri state referred to any other region than the north east it's typically only refers to NY-NJ-PA/CT where else is it used ?
"That term gets thrown around locally literally everywhere that three states meet. As a Kentuckian, I don’t even know which tri-state area people are referring to in my own state when they do that. There’s multiple."
I'm sure colloquially but in most of the corporate world tri state refers to the NY surrounding area
"Because you’re from that area I assume. I’ve honestly never even thought of it as one of the tri-states in the country until this exchange. It’s just New York City-New Jersey.

Edit:
Now that Jake responded I can edit this to say of course I’ve heard of New York City as part of a tri-state area. But sometimes you have to pretend to not know terribly obvious things about New York to mess with their defaultism."
I work for a international bank so it's not just where im from that tri state is referred to as NY. Other corporations mean the greater NY area when they say the tri state
🚩🚩🚩🚩
In ky that means Indiana ohio and ky
"Greater Cincinnati is indeed the marquee tri-state area Kentucky is lumped into. If you’re in central/northern Kentucky, that’s what you’ll think of.

Where KY, OH and WV converge in the Huntington, WV orbit, you get a bunch of river towns that will be the tri-state area for anyone that direction.

And if you’re in the southeastern Appalachian part of the state, the Cumberland Gap area near Middlesboro, KY where KY, TN and VA meet up is the one you’ll think of. You will definitely find your fill of businesses in Kentucky and Tennessee calling themselves Tri-State So-and-So over there.

And I have no idea if there’s much tri-state identity going on for KY-IN-Il, KY-IL-MO or KY-MO-TN meeting areas. Anything west of I-65 in Kentucky is a mystical land I only hear about during weather reports or election season."
"I’ve heard it used to refer to PA/MD/WV, but like the other person said, it’s used literally everywhere 3 states meet, so online it’s very ambiguous."
"> I've never heard the tri state referred to any other region than the north east

Because you haven't lived near any other tri state regions, lmao."
"We have a five state region - South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Montana and Wyoming."
You mean tornado alley lol
"I have and have never heard it before other than reference to NY. Never heard it used in MD, FL, DC, or CA. 

Have friends that live in Chicago and in New England as well as Texas never heard them call any other region the tri-state. More often I hear metro in DC/MD."
"DELMARVA is one. Delaware, Maryland, Virginia. I’m sure they’re all over."
Never heard that one when I was in Maryland or DC
"It’s closer to PA, which is where I live. Exelon, the largest electric company in the US, even calls their subsidiary in that area “Delmarva Power.” It’s definitely a thing. Feel free to google."
It's not that I doubt it just never heard it before lived in PA as well for sometime.
This is specifically the Tri-State area Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz lives in and pays HOA fees to.
"Phineas and Ferb being set in ""the fictional city of Danville in an unspecified tri-state area"" is akin to The Simpsons being set in Springfield."
"Exactly. I've heard just about every region of the US call themselves a tri-state area.

***EDIT  Damn there's a [wiki page for it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-state_area) and by golly there's a lot of 'em"
Yes! Thank you!
Typically the Tri-State refers to NY-NJ-PA/CT
"Usually it's NY because nobody except a NYer assumes their particular area, which isn't unique for having 3 states together and in fact is ambiguous and could be 4 states, is the only ""tri-state"" anyone would want to talk about. See also: ""the city""."
"Tri state is not in reference to three states it's a triangular grid with 3 market points of interest and the region between it, think of the Bermuda triangle"
How did a radio station get a warrant issued?
Spoiler alert: they didn't 
"I need to hear some of this, anyone got a link?"
I'm not sure if they do this anymore for obvious reasons this was like over a decade ago when people actually used to listen the radio and not plug their phone in for Spotify
Had one who after I pointed to the no soliciting sign and declined their offer of a free estimate asked if I could spare any change.  Like wtf?
"A lot of shady contractor companies ""hire"" people in very dire straights on a fee-only basis. (No hourly wage, just a fee for every customer they bring in.)"
These looked like yuppie kids to be honest.
"The majority of people in dire straights don't look like the ""homeless guy"" stereotype. People living on the street is certainly a real thing, but most people who are homeless or close to homeless look like... well, kind of like ""yuppie kids"", actually.

I've certainly been in a place where I was without a job long enough that I did ""street hustles"" and asked people for spare change. I was living out of a backpack and crashing on friends' couches as I could, so while I had safe places to sleep and access to showers and such, I was homeless. When I went for interviews, I borrowed a suit. I took a shitty, exploitative job (selling magazine subscriptions) because I needed _something_. The company that hired me gave me a decent haircut and a uniform, and you'd have never known I was homeless when I showed up at your door."
Fairly certain homeless people don’t have an iron available to them.  They generally don’t have neat haircuts.  And they generally aren’t wearing expensive clean shoes.  I am not a complete idiot.  Just an incomplete one.
"So I just told you a story about being homeless where I absolutely had all of those things and your answer is ""no, I know better"". What a clown."
"Someone came by my dad’s house and did this. He was “working in the neighborhood.” 

The guy had all these big promises about how if he can’t get the work done a certain way it’d be free, and that he can get their homeowners insurance to cover it entirely.

My dad did the research. *it turns out this guy was legit.* He actually just wanted the business. They finished the work on time, as promised, and got my dad’s homeowner’s insurance to pay for all of it. 

I’m glad my dad didn’t get scammed but I was like “aww man, what are you doing providing an exception to this scam?!” And now here I am sharing it 😅 I can’t believe this was real."
"A lot of scams are sketchy people copying legitimate business/sales activities and then just absconding with the money (or doing a shit job or whatever).

The whole ""we're in the neighborhood"" thing started out entirely legitimately as a way to expand business. You're doing siding in a neighborhood? Send a foreman/sales guy driving around looking for other people nearby who could use siding, because hey ""your neighbor Bob is getting his siding done with us, see?"" is basically a light reference. Works well because presumably you think Bob has decent judgement. 

And because it works great, scammers have realized that they can lie about it and still have it work a fair percentage of the time."
"If it's for concrete work or anything needing heavy equipment you can actually get a good deal if they're working in the neighborhood since it let's them save on trips.

When I got my driveway done my neighbor got his done by the same contractor and he cut us a deal because of it."
"I had something similar happen, we had a roof with recalled shingles and AFAIK the people knocking on our doors were legitimately working in the area. And the reason I know that they were probably telling the truth about the shingles being recalled is that multiple people kept knocking on our door to tell us about them being recalled.

It seems that in this case it might not be a scam, and the scammers are just trying to blend in with the legit people."
"I had that happen and got ~25 year old roof replaced by insurance for that.

Basically where i live you by law insurance has to be able to replace the shingles with matching ones. In this case the shingles are recalled and can't be replaced. So you get a new roof and the guys driving around get a bunch of houses.

So companies will drive around after a wind event looking for older roofs with recalled shingles. There will always be some roof damage on old roofs so when an adjuster comes out they can't really contest it

Its been 6 years without leaks so i guess they did a decent enough job. They also didnt take payment until work was being done / after it was done."
"Just had this happen at my grandma’s house. Thankfully I was visiting and told him no. 

He was “working on a neighbor’s house and noticed our windows looked old.”"
"""yeah we were just working on your neighbor Johns house down the street"""
John? Maybe Juan or Won. You're in the wrong neighborhood bro.
"I had some kid trying to sell windows, legit company just shitty sales people, come up to me as I'm working in the yard and go "" It looks like your windows are kind of old, would you be interested in new high efficiency ones?"" 

I looked at him and went ""Which windows? You mean the ones I replaced this summer? You're just gonna walk up and insult my house to try to sell your windows?"" The kid was mortified. He had no response. I was like I know you were given a script but just don't use it if the windows don't actually look old."
I had some AT&T rep at target tell me that my provider sucks and to change to theirs. Like fuck you for insulting my choice of phone company
I feel bad for him...
Me too. It's why I didn't yell at him. I wanted him to feel a bit dumb but not totally shot.
"My grandma got conned by some guys doing this, although it was a long time ago. They offered to replace the driveway at her house and she agreed to it, and they basically destroyed it. By the time my dad found out about it and tried to track the guys down who did it, they were long gone."
Human popup ads.
"I am stealing this, thank you!"
"Share and Enjoy. It's literally true... They interrupt what you're doing, you generally don't want what they're selling, and more often than not they're actively malicious. I rarely even answer my door anymore unless I'm expecting something. The few people who come over know to text rather than knock or ring the bell because it freaks out my cats."
"Yeah, I had some travelers insist my trees needed to be pruned because of fire codes and they’d report me if I didn’t hire them. I told them to knock themselves out because no one can get hold of the permits department in my city."
"My landlord had the roof replaced and not too long after I got a knock on the door from a different roofing company that just happened to be driving down the street and just happened to notice that my roof was in very poor condition and it desperately needed to be replaced before the next rain storm.  Coincidentally, he was offering a discount and if I could move my car so he could set up a ladder he'd offer me a free estimate.  I needed to make a decision in the next few moments while he went to his truck to get the paperwork.

I just played kinda stupid and told him I'm just had work done on it but I'll have to call the landlord and so on.  He didn't look happy but left me with his card and left."
I get spam fliers in my mailbox for tree services like this all the time. It's annoying.
"A contractor came out to my rural store that got a lot of parking lot traffic unrelated to my business (\*grumble\*) and offered to fix up the highway ramps for a stupid low price.

I was aware of the scams but the price was good and it didn't have to be *that* good of a job, I really just needed some material down (with transportation, gravel that I spread by hand would have cost more), but they did a fantastic job.

I guess they really were highway contractors with extra asphalt they didn't want to have to pay to dump."
In Michigan there was a serial killer targeting women that started each interaction with offering to clean their gutters.
"Some guy knocked on my door last week doing this, asking did I need the gutters cleaned and the front of the house washed. Now, fair play, I actually HAD been intending to ring a local company about it.

He quoted me €100, which was more than I knew I'd pay the company, so I said I'd chat with my wife about it and asked for their card so I could ring them. No cards, had to be today. He asked how much I'd be willing to pay, I told him (truthfully) I had no cash in the house. Ok, but could I GET cash today? I said no. He gave me his phone number and said to ring as soon as I spoke with my wife, but I had to ring TODAY.

I did not."
We had the driveway scammers make the rounds the last couple of summers.  At best they do a shiity job.. sometimes they just take the deposit and disappear.. and sometimes they tear out some of the driveway and never come back.
Haven't heard of this one. How does it work ? What's their endgame ?
“I’ve pressure washed a lot of your neighbors houses”….every damn year right after pollen season
"I nearly fell for the energy company version of this, but my dog hates strangers being on the front porch, so he was barking his head off the whole time. And I was like “I’m sorry… my dog… is there a way I could do this online? What was the company name again? Yeah I know you could do it now, but you see, my dog… He just doesn’t like strangers…”

And the guy was then like, “Um don’t worry about it. Just forget it” and basically RAN away

Alright. Thank you to my anxious dog for getting me out of that one"
"A few years ago we had a hail storm and a company came through knocking on doors to tell people they needed their roof fixed.  A lot fell for it and after paying discovered their insurance wouldn't cover it because they didn't go through insurance first.  Well, just had a hurricane come through and every single one of those houses had their roof leak.  None of them needed the new roof in the first place.  And where is that company?  Gone.  Nowhere to be found.  My spouse tried to warn people but they wouldn't listen."
Those asphalt/concrete ones can be legit. It's going to go to waste if they don't unload it.
"""We got a flat tyre so we need to get this asphalt unloaded ASAP! We'll do your whole driveway for a quarter of the normal price!""  
It will be the thinnest asphalt you've ever known and will fall to pieces in no time"
"Yeah, bullshit excuses is a red flag. But ""hey, we're coming next week and doing three houses in your area, so we'll offer you a discount if you want yours done too"" can be a legit win-win, as the cost of transport is so high for some things."
"You need to know your area's scam season, and check if they're bonded, insured, and licensed in your state in the off-season. If I see women and children with accents begging outside grocery stores, I know it's scam season and their husband/father is out running an asphalt or tree service scam while the mom and kids are out begging. Lotta those fuckers live in McMansions and make waaaaaaaaay more money that I ever will. Those fuckers travel up to my Northern state from the South when the weather gets warm down South."
"We had a woman who'd lay out a blanket in the Aldi cart cove with a baby on it doing this. People will get upset if you criticize her because she's just begging for food or loose change, but the reality is she's looking for bigger payouts where they buy her a car or rent her a place to live with a 3rd party who is in on it"
Why
"Lots of shady contractors demand payment upfront usually from elderly individuals, do the demo and never come back to complete the job. Happens way more than you think across the U.S. and most these people are stupid enough as well to use their real identity or business logo to scam these people.

 It's predatory not to mention shady contractors can also rob your place. My landlord had plumbing work done on an old college apartment I was living in years ago and the assistant plumber still had the keys to our apartment and stole my mountain bike while i was still in the house sleeping! it was probably worth 2k at the time and even though I reported it the landlord didn't wanna give the police the name of the plumbers because he regularly contracted them for cheap!"
"Because 10 times out of 10, someone showing up at your door to do work on your house is scamming you. They’ll have you sign some official-looking-but-actually-bullshit paperwork, demand payment up front, go hire a day laborer from the nearest home improvement store for a fraction of what they’re making, make that guy do all the work while they sit in a truck watching, will usually try and escalate scope or materials pricing and demand cash to make those purchases up front (another tip: be familiar with rough material costs - these guys love to charge 10x for people who don’t know any better). 

The big one is that if something goes wrong with work they’ve done, say someone gets hurt walking up masonry steps, or something like that, they’re not a real company and can’t be held responsible. 

They’ve gotten super lazy lately too - the easiest tell is out-of-state plates and trucks with no branding on them. All contractor trucks should have their licensing info on it somewhere. If the truck is clean of any kind of business tags, immediate suspicion."
"In addition to what others have said, often its a way to get you ""on the hook"" for more money. They'll quote you $50 to pressure wash your house and then ""oh, man, we noticed this thing that needs repair; we can do that for you for $500"" and either it's entirely bullshit or _they actually broke it_.

Or they'll ""I noticed your front walk needed it, so I went ahead and did that too, so actually you owe me $200"", and if you don't pay it'll be threats and ""I'll put a lien on your house"" and other stuff that works surprisingly well on a lot of people."
"I never expected them to call me. Claiming my roof was old and needed replacing (it's 7 years old and still looks brand new). 

Wasn't even a spam number."
"Especially love the ones who say ""Okay well I'll come back in a week"" I actually cut off the kid saying that mid sentence with ""No you wont"" and I followed him off my driveway. I'm no a scary looking guy, I look like a dork, but it worked."
"My mother did this once for someone who was sealing driveways or something.

Dude sealed her driveway and I'm pretty sure it all washed off a couple weeks later when we got a really hard rainstorm."
"You gave me quite the chuckle, because that ""We're working in your area"" thing is so true! Seriously, what actual contractor would ever say that?!"
Or the related “we were in the area delivering steak to restaurant X but they were unable to pay/over ordered/ closed and we can’t return because boss/health department rules/truck is at the end of the route and we have a deal on frozen ribeye/filet/t-bone steak”. “Steak” turns out to be expired meat or incredibly low quality that the buyer won’t find out about until it thaws.
this is a menace with insta having many such videos​
"I've seen a lot of these fellas doing window cleaning and roof work free of charge because the neighbors has hired them and will do some work for free. 

It's mostly young white American people that creates these YouTube shorts so be careful when you get approached by these types of folks asking to clear up your driveway and such"
"> “Contractors”

Pretty much every single driveway contractor. Asphalt needs very heavy and hot equipment. The cheap crews will slap shit down that breaks up within a few months."
"Theres a routine scam in my neck of the woods: Some dude is gonna show up and say he needs to check your attic for whatever reason.

Its only an excuse to walk in and then figure if you are a good mark to come rob.

Most hilarious was when the dude said he was from a government program I just spent months on a waiting list to have an appointment. Sure, it takes months to get an appointment but someday they will just come and knock at your door!"
"On the flip side, there are reputable companies who do offer discounts for certain services on a particular week/whatever so they can save trip costs.

The driveway sealing place I've used for years always sends a card round for the week they want to do stuff in our neighborhood, and its 15% off that week. It's win-win -- a bunch of us do take them up on it when we're in need of service, they do a great job, we save some money, an they probably save way more than the discount by doing a handful of drives in the same area all at once rather than randomly driving all over."
"I had TruGreen and some pest control company show up and try to pull this. ""We're working with Dan next door and wanted to let you know you can get a group deal since your neighbors have already signed up."" I dont think the dude next door is even named Dan. Then when i tell them i'm not interested they pull the ""well just sign up now and no money is due for three weeks. You can cancel anytime before then so there's nothing to lose!"" I basically had to just shut the door in their faces"
"A similar scam is when there actually are workers in an area (for example, washing windows or mowing lawns), someone who's not affiliated with them will dress like them and go around knocking on houses ""Hi, we're doing XYZ services in your neighborhood today (point to them currently working at a different house), would you like this done on your house too? Cost is $X."" and then collect payment and leave."
I hate when people show up and tell them they're from the electric company and need to see your bill. And then they change providers on you and you're suddenly paying so much more for utilities
"It's good to hear this is a scam. I've had these folks stop at my house a dozen times since buying it, and always took their offer at face value. I never trusted them to do work on my house, though."
had to tell one of these guys several times thru a closed door to leave the property - came to spray for spiders at 7pm. He got quite aggressive and really wouldn’t take no for an answer - ended up emailing his company bc he kept asking me “do u even know who I work for” - so his spraying company got a complaint from me with his name . I still don’t know if he was legit or not but very aggreasive
"Shoot, somehow these guys keep calling my phone about that!"
"""Oh, hi! We're putting in new windows for your neighbor on \[two streets away -- they know damn wall I'm not going to know them\], would you be interested in an estimate?"" 

Never get the estimate! You'll be screening those calls for years to come.

I've lost track of the number of times I've explained that ""I just got laid off, we're probably going to get foreclosed on"" to random salespeople. And those guys will still keep trying to talk to me! (My go to, in general, with people trying to scam or sell me is ""I'm dying"" or ""I'm poor"" -- I don't GAF, I'll traumatize them.)"
I ask which house and the can never tell me which.
"Years ago, my neighbor gave $40K to a contractor for an addition to their home.  Contractor promptly declared bankruptcy and ended his LLC.  Not the first time he had done that, either.

I never heard the eventual fallout from this.  But this reinforces the advice to vet your contractors."
"In Florida, these guys *were* scammers, but they were scamming your insurance company. We just made it illegal for them to do this within the last year."
"People just randomly show up offering to do construction work? Like, what, do they have a ladder on a truck outside, ""So hey, I noticed you have a chimney, want me to clean that for you for $500 bucks?"""
"Hell - I got a phone call from one trying to ""repair roofs in my area"" and when i asked how they got my name and number they hung up. Calling back got nothing but a ""this line is busy"" but was hosted by shady VOIP company.... 

https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/ - I use this site a lot and from what I understand and experience it actually works... I get fewer and fewer spam and shady calls\texts\emails over time."
"I can't imagine anyone is just sitting there, someone comes to their door, and suddenly they're like - you know what, I do need new windows! (or whatever)"
"My wife fell for something similar - guy was redoing blue stone driveways and had ""extra"".  She was frazzled and just agreed and paid.  Yes, they did our driveway but my friend who works said it looked pretty subpar.  I filed with the Secretary of State's office and he called and was PISSED.  I laid into him saying that's not legit, it's even on the SoS website it is a common scam, he has no online presence and it's a shitty way to do business."
"There was a ""company"" doing driveways in my area with that scam. Law enforcement agencies got a hold of them and 4 of them got deported back to Mexico because they were wanted there.  How they made to Canada before being caught, I have no idea."
"Had to get some siding work done a year or so ago and we were considering just replacing all of it instead of a few trashed panels.  
Searched for companies and even checked to see if they were licensed/insured/etc and contacted a few for quotes.  
One guy responded and could come by the same day, so I let him poke around and at one point realized he'd climbed up on to the roof.  
He finishes poking around and proceeds to tell me my roof is shot to hell from hail, shows me pics of the ""damage"", but he can get insurance to cover a replacement for free!  Also trying to get a quote on the siding work was like pulling teeth from a tiger, when I finally got one it was 2x what anyone else wanted.  
I foolishly signed some paperwork letting him talk to my insurance about it but also told him I'm expecting more companies to come by for quotes.  He still put in the claim request, but basically ghosted me and in the mean time the other companies came by and the second company quickly called BS on the first.  Even showed me around the roof pointing out the ""damage"" the first guy was talking about, which was maybe 3 tiny dents and the rest was just manufacturing defects.  
Talked to insurance about the claim, cancelled it, and even shared with them details about what I'd been told and observed.  
  
Moral of the story; A company can be licensed/insured/etc with a lot of good reviews and still be a scammy den of assholes."
Scam contractors are qualified in all those things but if you hire someone that has to go door-to-door to find work you deserve to be scammed
Had one for roofing after a storm. Vetted him on the spot for about ~45 and discussed plans and materials. Guy was legit local business but just starting off as a gen contractor. In the middle of it another showed up that was more front of professional and scammer on work. It's hilarious to watch a scammer squirm out when they're marked during conversation.
"Have Sales, Use and Contractor's Excise tax licenses (every state is different) and are in Good Standing with the Secretary of State.  All of this can be looked up on your State's SOS website."
"Had one of those show up years ago for asphalt work, said ""how much to fill in between the garage and existing driveway?  He gave a super low price, I said ""do it"".  Driveway is still in good shape, over a decade later.  Wish one of those would show up at my new house, I got work for 'em!"
"I always love the ""we've been working in your neighborhood"" line. I'm home most of the time during the day, so I always just ask them ""where/when. I've been home all day and haven't seen a thing"" watching them squirm and stumble to their next line is kind of satisfying. After that I just stonewall them with ""not interested"" until they get off my property."
"We got a new roof last summer. It looked (still looks amazing) With a highly reputable company in my area and we knew SEVERAL other people who recommended them. 

Right after a storm (roof still looked, and still looks brand new) we got 4 different people knocking at our door saying that they noticed how old our roof was from the road and they were working in our area. SO thy thought they would do the neighborly thing and give discounts to anyone in the neighborhood who signed up with them today. 

They almost all had the same story. Like exact same. 

And sadly, one neighbor around the corner used one of these scammers. The next bad storm (like 3 weeks after their roof was finished) they had really bad roof leaks and so forth. 

Our neighbors across the street (3 different houses worth) all recommended the folks we chose. Two sets had theirs done over 8 years ago, and they still look like it was done last month. 

We do not use ANY unsolicited contractors or products for ANYTHING!!!"
"The email/text “this is the United Postal Service, your package has been delayed, we need you to verify name, address, and card information for delivery” gotten those dozens of times when I don’t have any packages on the way, but a ton of friends have fallen for it.

Edit: a word"
"I got a text the other day informing me that my vehicle was parked in a no-parking spot and that I should click the link to follow up. 

Jokes on them - I don't own a vehicle!"
Jokes on them! I’m too poor to have a vehicle of a package!
"Oh gosh, I have got those a TON

And funny thing is, I fell for it the 1st time, but luckily my bank smelled what was happening and denied the transaction

Said texts always seem to come on the day of a scheduled delivery too"
"i get these often enough, and usually have packages on the way, but have text alerts and the shop app for tracking. so, no, i’m not falling for these. delete and block."
"Hilariously, a buddy of mine *only* receives those texts to his *Postal* work phone."
"This one got me because I actually had a package go missing in the post and I had given my number to three different Postal employees that week so it didn't seem that strange that one of them had texted me instead of called. 

Luckily I'm also a dumbass so I entered the wrong email + password combination into the phishing site it took me to, so there's that. "
"I'm pretty sure I've had that email a few times, and I don't even live anywhere near the USA."
Everyone gets them. I'm from NZ and even I've had them
I'm in Aus! It's so ridiculous.
"These ones are actually quite well done sometimes. To the point where I always double check my real delivery messages to make sure they are real. They are obvious to spot when you haven't made a delivery, but when you just recently made one and you get a message from the same delivery company you are expecting a parcel from and it doesn't ask for any details, just to press some link, it becomes easy to fall for. My dad once got a fake text straight after ordering an item and it looked so legit with the exception of having suspiciously bad grammar because it probably was machine translated message."
"That's a brutal scam because if it can hit at the right time, it works. I had an overdue package with unclear tracking information then I got an email that had all the right details. It was only because I was aware of these scams that I was sceptical of it."
"It's the only scam that's ever got me, and for the exact reason you just stated. I had never heard of it and it hit at the right time. 

""What do you mean the postage was $1.27 short? I need that here today! Here, get it done! SHIT!""

I realized as I was pressing send that I shouldn't be, but it was too late. Luckily I caught it quick enough that they didn't do any damage, but they tried! Within minutes they were trying to fill up their ride at a gas station"
"It was even more messed up for me, I had an overdue package and the tracking info hadn't changed for a week, I was ordering from the UK to Hungary and then I get this email with a UK address for a real UK delivery company. I can only assume it was a great coincidence or at least a well designed phishing attempt that uses whatever information it can find on me to tailor the scam, but it really seemed like it had to be the real thing and this was why my package was late. I think if I wasn't a fan of 'scam' content on youtube, I would have fallen for it but instead a few alarm bells began ringing so I copied the email and independently looked up a customer fraud/service address for that company to ask them if this was legitimate or not. They got back to me and said ""no, absolutely do not click on those links""."
Lucky you!  I started going to scam subs after this and have saved both my mother and aunt from things since because of it. They ain't getting me again. I'm ashamed enough as it is.
"I've gotten a couple texts from ""ups"" about ""Your package is being held at your local facility, please go to [insert sketch link here]"" 

Like, nice try buddy but I'm always watching my packages like a hawk because UPS either does the knock and dash or just dumps it at my front door for the rest of the town to see"
My favorite one of those texts was when someone took a photo of a tv at Walmart to tell me that my order is being delayed 😆
literally just got one of these this morning
Edit: a word 
"I always reply with “oh that’s fine send it back and I’ll use FedEx, ups or dhl when I reorder!”"
"Got one of those calls from a man with an obvious Australian accent. Told him my name was Joe Mama and he crashed out, started screaming and cursing over the phone."
"I wonder if these work on immigrants to U.S. a lot.

I did a study abroad and ordered something online because it was on clearance and was baffled that I had to pay some kind of import fee for the purchase, completely canceling out the clearance, it was like 30% or 40%. Never seen anything like thay in the U.S., but my package was held and I recieved it fine once I paid the fee."
"I get those all the time. Roll eyes, report as spam, blocked. I also get similar ones telling me there's an issue with my Amazon package delivery. 🤦"
They always have the worst typos too
This one isn't surprising. People get stoked about receiving packages so it's easy to get blinded by the excitement. Still dumb but not surprising at all
"People that fall for the post office ""$2 to unlock your package"" text messages"
"I was behind some old guy in the line at the post office who was complaining that the post office was charging him $2 to collect a parcel. He showed me an e-mail on his phone from a very obviously sketchy e-mail address and told me he was going to figure out if this was real or not, and if it was he was going to pay the $2 in person. I told him it was a scam but he said he was fairly sure it wasn't because nobody would go to that sort of length for just $2.   
I explained that as soon as he gives them his credit card details they would be taking a lot more than $2 but he didn't understand as he started talking about how $2 isn't much, but if they are doing it to a lot of people then that could add up to a lot. He walked up to the counter and the lady there told him it was a scam.   
I hope she gave him some sort of handout because he was ignoring all of the red flags"
"This is always their reasoning ""it's only $2. Why would they scam for $2?""

Bro....you're literally giving them your credit card information wtf dont you understand? It's not just $2 🙄🤣"
"Generally, it is only $2 though.

Let's assume these ""groups"" message 20,000,000 people.

Let's assume 5% pay the $2.

Let's assume 50% of that 5% did a chargeback after realizing it was a scam.

That's still $1,000,000.

These are all made-up numbers, but in the scheme of things, most people aren't going to spend an hour on the phone to chargeback $2. That's why they charge such a low amount."
"""Whoops! I accidentally charged $2000 to your card! I'll need a small fee to reverse that, your credit card can't be used again so please send me your bank information to pull $5 from to process it!"""
"A lot of people seem surprisingly eager to just hand out credit card details. I work for a UK based online retailer and many, many times people have emailed us with their credit card details just right there in the email wanting to place orders. To the point I have an email written up explaining exactly why you can't just email random companies your credit card information and that's not how you place an order. Yes, it's just the Americans that do this. Then it creates a massive headache for IT to scrub the details from our servers so we don't get a GDPR strike against us, because the UK and Europe take data privacy super seriously, and rightly so."
"Yep. Found out a friend fell for it SEVERAL times. And many other postal related scams. They just happened to mention during a conversation that they had stopped at the post office and dropped off the $2 redelivery fee because they didn't think they had paid for the package they got that day. And I stopped and asked what redelivery fee...which opened the door to me giving a lesson on..how to actually verify website URLs...why is USPS texting you if you didn't sign up for updates.. redelivery is free....if you don't recognize a tracking number in a random text take a second to think - why would a package marked international have a country code in the tracking that is your own country? USPS is also not going to text you that an address doesn't match - because how are they going to know who it goes to and the number to text? 


I even went into more nuanced things that are super obvious to me but get overlooked - we are in the US. We do not refer to it as courier. There were a couple other language mismatches. Plus how to read a phone number and see that it's international - why would USPS be texting from an international number?


They then had to inform several other friends it was all fake and to contact their banks because they've all been paying these fees and responding to these texts with their info."
"> why would USPS be texting from an international number

Unfortunately, most companies use these generic numbers like 85115 or whatever for these ""automated text systems"", so it's not necessarily unusual to see weird numbers."
 I am aware that when it's a legit text they usually use these automatic text systems with short numbers. These scam texts came from full length phone numbers with the +(country code) - and apparently no one knew what a country code was. 
"I don't think a lot of ""online forum people"" realize how non-tech-savvy a lot of real world people are, especially the older generations. It's not that surprising that they wouldn't realize that unfortunately. :("
...in my example these were not older people. We are talking early-mid 30s. Millennials who came of age with technology and learning it. 
"...Okay? I said

>non-tech-savvy a lot of real world people are, especially the older generations. 

I'm saying people of all generations, ESPECIALLY the older ones. Just because you ""grew up with technology"" doesn't mean you know a lot about it. In fact, studies show that the easier technology becomes to use, the ""dumber"" the general society is about it, because the bar to entry is a lot lower."
"Got one of these bullshit text/mails once
   used a RNG one time use credit card with a dollar just to see who the merchant or payment processor was, traced it to a merchant in Cyprus. Almost immediately there were $900, $300 and $100 charges, all failed (no doubt they were trying to see how much they can take) No way to know if that's where the scammer was located since there was no other geolocational or meta data to go on.  Not really a thing you can do except chargeback with your bank.  

I hope people who fall for this at least use a credit card and not a debit card, infinitely easier to get your money with a CC. With DC you might as well handed them cash."
"My great-uncle left my great-aunt about 12 years ago when he realized that she was only with him for his money. When they got divorced she didn’t receive anything from the divorce so she was broke and she fell for pretty much every “get rich quick” scam you could think of but the one I most remember is her falling for that “if you send us [x] amount of money, we will give you [x] in return.” She sold her $16k car which was the only thing she got in the divorce and handed it over to some Indian scammer. And if that wasn’t bad enough, she did the same thing a few months later and lost another $7k. My grandmother still calls her a dumb ass over the situation because my grandmother tried to warn her both times and now she has a gambling problem and spends her social security checks playing online poker and always loses. My grandmother is now in charge of her finances because she obviously can’t be trusted to manage her own money. It’s crazy how money hungry some people are."
Some people just never learn.
"Except he was doing the right thing, heading to the post office to see if it was true. Good on him for checking up on it before paying it."
"I’ve talked to some older people who see scams and even when they recognize it’s a scam, their understanding of it is still wrong. Like “well this beautiful woman scammed me.” Brother it’s not a beautiful woman it’s organized crime in nigeria"
"As a clerk, it is depressing how many people come in asking if it's real. This guy, he looked 20s, said he paid twice. I figured someone his age would be tech savvy enough to realize it was a scam. I told him to contact his bank immediately."
I got one the other day that was asking for my credit card info for $0.02.
"Dude at my work fell for 4 scams in the last year.

usps $2 scam TWICE

Best buy geek squad invoice and he had never even used geek squad 

Amazon gift card scam

On the geek squad scam he even showed me the email beforehand, told me he had never used geek squad... 

I told him it was obviously a scam. He still called the number to try to ""straighten it out"" and ended up giving them his bank info."
It did give me pause because it looked official and I was expecting a late package.
I'd love to hear more about this guy because this is hilarious.
I have stories for days about this dude...lmao.

I got one of those the other day. It was about a week after I made an international order. Too bad I pay attention and my parcel cleared customs 3 days prior to the email.
"I got one allegedly from the Washington State Department of Transportation for Narrows Bridge toll fees. Trouble is, I've never driven across the Narrows in my own car, and why would WSDOT have a Quebec area code?"
"Inslee be like ""we're getting those road taxes one way or another!"" 🤭"
"Well all they got this time was the word ""penis"" repeated 50 times. Shockingly the text wasn't able to be delivered."
"I work for the post office in a relatively small Vermont town. Our office has about 1500 PO Box customers (we have no delivery).

We get TEN PEOPLE A DAY coming in asking something along the lines of ""Hey I'd like to show you something and ask your opinion..."" as they pull out their phone.

Before they even get the screen on I have out of my mouth ""Let me guess, a text message that says you have a package stuck in customers or that you need to update your address? Generally looks like 'Paragraph, hyperlink, paragraph?'""

Everyone is getting these. E V E R Y O N E. So many old people are falling for it. It sucks having to tell them that they've been scammed, and to expect a LOT MORE texts/emails/messages. :/"
"My mom fell for this. And my mom is an intelligent person. Seems strange to me. They maxed out her card. The card company didn't hold her liable for the charges though. 

And the last two times I've been to the past office, there have been people complaining that USPS overcharged their credit card."
Just got one of these as I was reading this thread lol
"I got one of these texts yesterday, reported it as junk straight away lol"
"Unfortunately, if you order from a foreign country, these emails are legit. You have to check the links and use a secure payment method (not your credit card)"
"Where I live, the postal services can indeed send you text/emails to inform you that you need to pay import duties for your package to be freed.     
Still, avoid any links present in those messages. Bookmark the official website and connect from here. Make sure you use the correct tracking number (the one that is provided on the site you ordered from) instead of trusting one that could be provided in these messages"
Yup. That is the proces
"My stepfather texted me a year ago saying ""your mom and I won a lottery, we just need to go to the store to get some cards to pay for the taxes"". Like cmon man, I know you are smarter than this. Thankfully enough all I had to do is ask him why would they make you use gift cards to pay taxes instead of just paying the IRS? He immediately connected the dots."
Glad he texted you
My dad did this without telling me.  Pretty much gave away his retirement nest egg getting scammed.   Glad you were there to stop it.
Yeah it’s hard bc older people’s brains just don’t understand things like this the same way they used to. Elder scams are so common bc of it
"I still do not get, at ALL, how ANYONE falls for this. I have watched Kitboga, and so many other people who scam the scammers and I just don't see how it would or could ever actually work. It is crazy."
Honestly the fact that those scammers ive seen in kitbogas channel have a full time job at a call center to just scam people is pretty telling that it is a successful endeavour. Enough people fall for scams for it to be a profitable business
They want so much to believe.
"I guess, but so much of it is relying on the mark to feel sorry for them having ""put too much back in your account"" ""I'll get fired because I transferred too much money!"" oh no!!

It does make me wonder what they'll move onto once that older generation is gone, although gullibility certainly isn't age dependent."
"Sorry, it's not a generational thing. Live long enough, you'll have all of the cunning and impulse control of a 5yo too."

You missed that he also said Swanson in there- her real last name.

Not the *whole* joke. My dumbass didn't realize for years that Samsonite is a common briefcase brand.

"Okay, you see what he did? He French-fried when he should've pizza'd. You French-fry when you pizza, you're gonna have a bad time"
"Ah, California."
What's crazy is how old that episode is and people are still saying yes. Last Week Tonight's episode on them kinda established very little has improved.
Balls
So mad I had to scroll this far for this.
Aassssssppeeeennnnnnn
You’ve had two pairs of gloves this whole?!
Aspen. That's a boy's name?
"I worked at a hotel where we full owners and also had timeshares. Real, full owners, almost never felt the need to tell you they were a unit owner. Timeshares almost always felt the need to say ""I'm an owner."" ><"
A place where the beer flows like wine and the women instinctively flock like the salmon of capistrano?
"Aspen, CO"
"When my dad was young, he bought a time share. How he didn't realize signing a contract for 99 years isn't scammy is beyond me, but he also has put in his social security number into pop-ups trying to get out of said timeshare."
Your dad might be an idiot.
"Yes, but his heart is in the right place. He bought it with every intention of bringing family together with ""affordable"" vacations."
"That's someone's dad, bro. That ain't nice."
"A lot of people's dads are idiots.

 I am a dad, and may also be an idiot."
WON’T SOMEBODY THINK ABOUT THE DADS!!!?? 😭
There are many idiots. Many are dads.
"My father has fallen for them all. It’s kinda funny, if not sad, how many religions he has been over his lifetime."
"My coworker went to a presentation on his lunch near where we worked. He was thinking about signing up with his fiance. The fiance was all swept up in the excitement of people singing up, popping champagne.


Be came back and was telling me the fees and how all the people who worked around us were buying them.

They were plants. Then I helped him break down the numbers and made him not do it .


They were a good idea in the 70s"
They were never a good idea
"My mom signed up sadly.  She got one in Florida 30+ years ago.  Ask me how many times we have been?  Zero.  We have traded it and had some great vacations and now that travel is so expensive it seems like a bit of a better deal than it used to IF we used our week at our timeshare...but we have to pay to belong to RCI so we can use a different week at other places we are more interested in.  So we pay for the fees every year for upkeep of our place near Orlando.  We pay to belong to RCI and then every week we book at another place, we pay around $250 I think to book that new place.  PLUS she had to pay for the week (I think that was approx $20K in 1993).  If she REALLY needed a time share, should have booked the nicest timeshare that we could easily drive a couple hours to THEN we could join RCI once every couple of years (maybe fore a few years at a time since the cost is less if you do that).  My mom is not wealthy...and when she dies, whomever becomes executor of her will is responsible for this unless she wills it to someone I am pretty sure.  The only thing that is good is that she has a good week at a great resort near Disney so we seem to get the best units at timeshares (I make sure we never go to an even remotely low end one)...but were kinda forced to use these things almost every year.  We've def wasted a few weeks when we couldn't go.  SUCH A SCAM.  There are some people they kinda work out for, but it's not like a true asset, and that should say all you need to know.  People pay to get rid of these things and I bet they are MUCH HARDER to sell then they have ever been.  If politicians weren't all crooked AF, they would be outlawed."
"When she dies I believe that any responsibility goes with her, including any debts. You shouldn't need to worry about paying anything."
"I don’t understand what exactly a time share is, even? Like why on earth would people have done that? Was there a benefit?"
"The idea of a timeshare is fantastic. It's the execution and the predatory nature of literally every seller that is the problem. 

Like, say you love baseball and the escaping to the beach. So every year you leave your freezing cold winter wherever and you had two weeks at a nice place, that's always the same, in sunny Florida during Spring Training. 

But you don't have to worry about anything else besides those two weeks. The rest of the up keep and everything is handled. It's your own comfortable personal hotel room. 

No matter what is happening at home or work, nothing matters. In two weeks you get to go watch baseball and nap on the beach!

But the problem is the people who sell you those two weeks are fucking assholes with insanely complicated contracts.

The idea is wonderful. But like everything, the people ruin it."
But isn’t that the same as a …hotel? Or even an air bnb? Why would someone choose a timeshare over that?
"They started waaaaay before air bnbs, my parents fell for it in the 90s. At the time, for a family wanting to vacation in the same spot it sort of made sense, you’d have a whole condo of space and a place to cook instead of eating out every meal (annoying with children)."
"My parents bought into West Gate down in Orlando  in the 90s when we were living in NJ when I was a kid because we’d go down there ALL the time. In theory timeshares sound good but holy shit they’re an absolutely terrible idea. It’s like having a second mortgage to go on vacation. They sell you on being locked into a set price forever and you just have to pay the maintenance fees and what have you. 

When I was turning 16, we ended up moving down to Orlando anyways and my parents stopped using it. Sure, they could have used West Gate elsewhere but they weren’t traveling anywhere else at the time. By then this was 2006 and the idea of a timeshare in my opinion has gone by the wayside. 

They ended up selling the timeshare back to them or someone else, I can’t remember. Idk how that part really even works to begin with. 

Anyways, it blows my mind how people still get timeshares and how they’re still in business. I’d rather pay for my hotel/airbnb as I go and not have a stupid timeshare which like I said is like paying for a second mortgage just to have a “free” week or two a year."
Time shares started in Europe in the 60s. The Swiss IIRC. They came to America in the 70s.
That’s a nice fun fact
"They didn't ""fall for it"" then if it worked for your situation."
"The main thing is you pay a large up front price and then after that you pay annual maintenance fees. So it’s supposed to be like locking in a price for life.  But there can be many, many things that can and do go wrong."
Yes the main thing that goes wrong is the monthly payments alone add up to more than just renting a random place for 2 weeks a year. It's an all around scam.
"It's a scam but back in the day it wasn't trivial to just rent a random place for two weeks. You were likely going to have to get involved with some kind of travel agent for that, so some extra cost on the ""just rent a place"" option. And then you'd have pay them every time you wanted to do a rental. So if you tended to vacation in the same place anyhow there was also some convenience on just dealing with the hassle and much of the cost of finding a place once and then not having to think about it again. 

I wonder what the age spread is on people still doing timeshares. I gotta think it skews pretty heavily old, with people who remember doing it or hearing about it back before the internet existed."
That's a great point. Probably gave a lot of people comfort knowing they didn't have to deal with agents and crap every year and their vacation was locked in. I'm old enough to have needed to print directions through mapquest for road trips. But I still had the internet in general...it just sucked a lot more than it does today. Hard to imagine a time where you just had to figure everything out on your own all the time.
"My grandparents used to rent a cabin on a lake from the 60s (when timeshares first popped their ugly heads up) They would pay a deposit before leaving the year they were in, to guarantee they would get it for the same weekend the next year. 

My grandmother and her second husband (grandfather and her divorced and then gran and my mom and aunt would go and then she remarried and her new husband would go) ended up buying a spot on the lake when they retired. 

The cabin thing. That lasted like 20 or 25 years. They never had to pay upkeep, never had to pay HOA fees, never had to pay groundskeeping fees. All the bullshit fees timeshares make you pay. And they go up every year. Yeah, every few years the cost of the cabin would go up a bit. But FAR less than all the fees timeshares hit you with yearly. And if they couldnt make it one year, (which happened once due to their divorce) They told the man that owned the cabin. He let my gran and mom and aunt have it a few weeks later and told someone else the weekend had come up available. The guy owned 4 or 5 cabins on the lake. All with docks and came with fishing boats included for your time. (aluminum boat with low end motor, nothing fancy) He also have canoes and rowboats he would loan you for free. 

Sadly, after he died, his kids kept doing this for a decade or so, and then their kids (the old man's grandkids) sold all the property. The places became mostly Air BNBs. All but one. Bought by a nice lesbian couple that was friends with my grandmother until she sold her place at the lake to move to Houston after my step grandfather passed away so she could be closer to my me (so I could go to a better school than the janky assed hick school where my mom lived), my mom, and my aunt."
"I typically tell people it’s not worth it to start from scratch but having inherited one I reluctantly deal with it. For my yearly maintenance fees (~1800) I can stay at a property that’s much nicer and roomier than if I were to pay out of pocket for an air bnb. The properties however are limited and can be hard to book for the time you want. Also as stated earlier, it’s the up front cost and the sales pitches when ur trying to relax that’s annoying af. More damned if you do than if you don’t at the end of the day imho but not the worst “scam.” At least you’re getting something in return."
I am set to inherit one and I have not decided how I want to handle it.
"Fight it.  Don't accept.  There must be a way around that.  No one will make me take my moms.  Good luck with that.  If i had a ton of money, I would prob take it but the maintenance fees are scammy (when you add up all the weeks for each unit and then all the units-that money could maintain the Taj Mahal and realistically some are not maintained nearly as well as they should be, so that's another profit center for them.  Plus the fees for exchanges and RCI.  If you ""owned"" a percent of a home, that would be a true asset that should be somewhat easy to sell.  These are impossible to sell.  Trust me, if they were easy to sell the secondary sales market would boom...but it's more like carrying around an annual bill that has a potential benefit...but most people don't want to keep going to the same place and can't always go at the same time.  Etc. etc."
"Go search eBay for ""timeshares for sale"" and sort by recently sold.

It's crazy how anyone could still be suckered into these in this day and age when a quick Google search will show eBay sales for pennies on the dollar."
"No one can force you into a timeshare arrangement.  You have to agree to it yourself.  So when your relatives try to send it to you as an ""inheritance"", simply ignore it and don't sign any documents."
"Math. People need to have at least 4th grade math. Unfortunately, in the US, lots of people don't. The numbers speak for themselves how dumb and stupid it is. "
"The ""idea"" is that you'll have a tangible asset at the end (similar to renting vs owning your property) of your holidays that has value and that you can sell on etc.

The reality is that the contractual middle-men extract all the value for themselves while leaving you all the cost and risk (similar to retirement villages, air bnb, uber, delivery apps, etc)."
And can't you will it to your family?
"You can but they are largely considered liabilities and not assets due to their predatory fees and inaccessible usage restrictions. 

Imagine getting willed a Netflix subscription that you could only use to watch movies between 5am and 7am unless you did a bunch of paperwork for each movie. Sure, that may have worked for your retired parents who watch movies in the morning and are made of time to fight paperwork, but it's basically just a monthly fee to get nothing to anyone with a full time office job."
"A better example is paying up front for a lifetime of Netflix, that you could only use during a certain few days of the year...but then you still have to pay per month (or year) to maintain the website...and if you decide you'd like to use another streaming site and lend netflix to a family member or friend for your time, they would be charged a large fee for using what you already paid for.  They get you coming, going and a few other ways.  It's legal crime and no doubt protected by a massive lobby or else it would be criminal.  If someone works in Time Share Sales, never talk to them ever, they are worse than a used-car salesmen (some of them might be okay but prob not many)...people that work at the resorts are just reg folks, but the salespeople learn quickly that they are basically scamming...and only a scumbag would stay in that business.  There are lots of shitty people in the world, but I put them up there with people that pray on the elderly.  At 18 when my mom came home from Florida saying she bought one I immediately knew she had been had to some extent...which I was a little older, I would have somehow got her out of it.  It's really hard after 30 years!!!"
Only if you hate them
"The Last Week Tonight episode noted that many time share contracts you have to reject ""inheriting"" the timeshare contract in order to avoid taking over the liability. Considering many timeshares sell for practically nothing it feels predatory that it is even legal."
"Yes, because it's technically actually property (it's a share though, not ""real property"" like a house -- more like stock). It's basically worthless property because there's no demand, and it's extremely difficult to find anyone to buy it from you.

It's only useful if you'll actually use the reserved time and location _every single year_, and if the fees are less than you'd spend to stay in that time and place in a hotel/airbnb/whatever. 

Otherwise, whoever inherits it is getting a white elephant they'll have to pay to get out of. Fortunately, you can simply _refuse to accept_ property offered to you, in which case the property is abandoned and not your problem. But talk to an attorney, because you have to actively do things -- you can't just ignore it or say ""I don't want it"", there's paperwork."
"Only if you are a complete piece of shit and hate them with all your soul. 

I mean, then you could."
"also the cost of your tangible asset is like 10x the value.   that's why they're so many timeshare companies, they're just insanely lucrative.  putting aside the fees for service which aren't negligible they're selling a 1.5 million dollar vacation house for 15 million dollars."
But what if someone else wants it during your holiday?
"They can't use it if it's your turn. You only have access to the timeshare during the time you own, so no one else can use it outside of their time either. This gives them basically no flexibility, so if your vacation this year doesn't line up with your timeshare time, you're shit out of luck and can't go. 

Personally, I'd rather just book a hotel. No long term commitment, I can change location or exact dates every time, there are more services with a hotel than a time share, and I'm not paying for it all the dang time with no refund possibilities if I need to cancel for whatever reason (depending on the specific hotel policy)"
"A lot of them use points now instead of weeks, so you buy a certain number of points and the various rooms have a set point cost depending on size and season. Disney and Marriott's both work like this."
Basically anything to obfuscate the costs and lower the utility over time.
"The ironic thing is between cash stays and point rentals, non members can game the system and get awesome stays and amenities for dirt cheap comparatively. My family is not MVC members but we have a Marriott condo property we stay at all the time and it's the best kept secret. A 3 bedroom condo and access to the main hotel pool with no resort fees for like $250 a night. We just unplug all the phones on the first night so their sales pitch call doesn't come through 😂"
Yep I definitely see that and it’s why it’s such a bizarre concept to me. Thanks for those who took the time to explain it to me!!
"Hotels raise their rates in times of high demand. In Plato's ideal of a time share, everyone equally pays for all 52 weeks of the year. In this hypothetical, if they get a timeshare that has 2 weeks during Spring Training available, this person would be saving money."
"Then it turns out the 52 weeks aren't equal in demand, who would have thought?"
except they're not paying 1/26th of the price for the two weeks.  more like 1/8
"And the 2 weeks they wanted were the same that 10 other people wanted, but meanwhile all the hottest days of summer are still available."
"Oh don't worry, timeshares also increase their rates/fees for high demand times as well."
"Math
Look up their numbers and try it. It NEVER makes sense. People just don't have 4th grade level math. "
Got it! Yeah I could see that…
"Because those didn’t used to be things years ago.  Back when timeshares were pretty popular, they were a good concept.  Keep in mind even having a microwave and a fridge in a hotel weren’t even the norm back then.  They were also seen as a status symbol for some.  

The two times I’ve been to one, they were places where a hotel would’ve been way more expensive and/or less convenient.  For example, the one I went to for skiing was in a cabin on the ski property.  Ski gear was already there, so no need to rent most things, we had a kitchen to cook food, didn’t have to worry about parking costs or waiting on others to finish skiing and could go back to the cabin whenever, etc.  For my friend’s family, this is what they did every year around the same time of year, so it was convenient for family vacations 

Part of the problem was getting out of the contract.  They’re hard to sell for one thing.  The fees are expensive, and dates can be limited, so if you can’t get the time off, you eat the costs."
Also the fact that 26 people are all vying to go for more or less the same peak season and that most people don't actually want to feel stuck going on holiday to the same place every single year.
"It’s the same as a hotel if not better because your not trying to get the days or weeks you want to take off lol 

Timeshare great hunny we are set now! Let’s go away for thanksgiving weekend (you & 100 other occupants say)"
If you travel like most people with kids it's tough cuz everyone is booking the same time frame.  If your a DINK it makes more sense
Fixed vs variable pricing.
Because they’re sold as an investment that you can pass down to your heirs.
"If they are like my in-laws, then they can claim they are owners and that they own a place in Montana. It’s all about ego and prestige. Nevermind they would save literally thousands of dollars and get to pick the time and place each time if they just did a hotel, that doesn’t sound as cool."
"It's always overpaying for some dumpy place in the US too.

You've got one life, with only a week or two of vacation each year, and you want to commit indefinitely to Pigeon Forge or Branson? Wtf?"
"Yeah I can see that it would totally be about illusion and “oh we have a vacation home,” clout. Which, yeah, doesn’t really translate for our generations. We can’t afford one house much less vacations houses for 2 weeks? If that’s even owning…"
"This. I think the illusion of ownership I think is a big factor in people getting time shares. They don't have any meaningful input in the property and they rarely build any meaningful resale value, but for their week a year they can engage in their fantasy."
"Most timeshare plans today allow you to convert time from your base property to other properties around the world. So if you pay for a week of time at a place in Miami you can use that to get a week in Paris for a steep discount. There is a ton of flexibility built into them, really it’s less a timeshare and more a holiday fund you pay into each month to spread the cost over time instead of having to save a lump sum. Still not a good value overall for most people, but you aren’t only stuck with the one place you “bought”."
"It’s technically a real estate transaction, so timeshares are valued because they could potentially be worth more money in the future when you sell it. (As with any real estate investment)

But like any real estate transaction, always always ALWAYS get a real estate attorney before signing ANYTHING"
A coworker bought one so he would be forced to take vacation. He was a workaholic and knew he  wouldn't take any time off if he hadn't prepaid.
Well you also get a stake in it that you can presumably sell which is actually incredibly difficult in practice
"Like, you own it? I’m sorry I’m sure I sound dense but this is such a weird concept to me. Is it that you’re guaranteed to have a place in the location you want at the time you want to be there as a price you pay over the year instead of all at one time? Otherwise I see no benefit to a timeshare over a hotel. 🤷🏽‍♀️"
You own a part of it yes. So it's like a bunch of people going in on a house together and having a schedule of who can visit when
"Not any more. That was when timeshares first started. In the old days, you actually got a share of the property. Deeded real estate. Now they just sell points which equate to time. So x number of points might be a week or two stay somewhere. Problem is, they sell more points than time is available. This means it's near impossible to get the  week you want because everybody else wants that same week. If they want more money, they just sell more points even though there is no more time."
"There is no benefit, except for having a vague sense of ownership. It typically means you end up locked in going to the same place every year (and it’s extremely difficult to sell off your portion of a timeshare if you want to get rid of it). You have a lot more flexibility just renting a hotel room for vacation each year."
"I mean, you can technically sell a piece of turd, and it's a wayyy better investment than a timeshare, but it's hard to find another dumbass who hasn't graduated from 4th grade and can't do basic math. That's why people can't sell it. It's a vety stupid ""investment"" (it's NOT an investment)."
"The idea is that because you have bought a share of ownership, you can then vacation there for free every year at your appointed time, saving you the money you would spend on a hotel.

What they gloss over is the fees associated with ownership that basically cancels out this benefit."
Because 20 years ago you could have a nicer place than a hotel room and pay less money.
Timeshares never made much sense but they made slightly more sense before airbnb existed
"Yes. But very stupid people who can't think it or do math will fall for it. And in a country where education is as bad as it is in the US, lota of people will fall for it. It's absurd how stupid it is. "
"This. In most cases a timeshare isn't cheaper than a comparable hotel or Airbnb, but it's even less flexibility. That's even before the maintenance fees often grow faster than most other things so the value often only gets worse."
It's basically a contractually obligatory hotel stay. It's just odd to me.
"No no no, a timeshare is the same damn spot every time you go. Instead of having flexibility, you lock yourself into one space. It's worse than a hotel."
It's more like you and a bunch of friends buy a vacation home and split the costs while also dividing up the year so you never use it at the same time.  Except with extra fees and hoops because a 3rd party gets involved to write the contract and the other people aren't actually your friends but randos the 3rd party found for the purposes of making the sale.
"my parents had one but you can also change locations of your timeshare. so my parents bought timeshare in aruba (don’t ask me why lol) 

but every 2 years when it was time to use it we would change the location to disney. there’s a price to it but it was still cheaper than going straight through disney. although i don’t think it makes much sense now"
"A timeshare includes a deed, which means you own a tiny piece of it (if you buy 2 weeks you essentially own 1/26th of the timeshare property)."
"It doesn't make any sense to me. I understand it, and people are talking about benefits here when responding to you, but...

My mom and her hubs bought a timeshare... got it for 4 weeks out of the year so it worked for them. They'd head down to Florida for Spring Break and for 2 weeks in winter. 

The issue... even though it was paid off, they were still paying 800 bucks a month (for maintenance costs and other fees). When they told me that, I immediately said, ""WTF? You only get it for 4 weeks a year.""

They only kept it for 2 years and then sold it. They find a different place to stay every time they go down now."
It never made sense to me
"It's not just a room like a hotel -- it's at minimum an apartment/condo. And you actually own a share in it, you aren't just renting (this is a two-edged sword as it also makes it really annoying to get out of); which means it's the _same exact place_ each time, not a randomly-assigned room. You pick out one where you like the view/location/etc. and buy a share in it.

Classically, you owned a _specific period of time_, often a month or more; so like if you bought a share in a condo in Las Vegas for the month of February, that place is guaranteed for that time. The providers offer a path to trading your time and place with other customers (and how this is handled is usually where the scammy parts take root), but the basic idea was you had your reserved weeks with predictability at a much lower and more predictable cost than a hotel."
"Timeshares predate airbnb, and not every place has a hotel or has available booking and some people like to ""feel in charge"" i guess?"
"Well, the main difference (ideally) would be you own it. The property gains value, so it is a property investment. Theoretically in 20 years when you sell it will have matured in value, or you keep it and will only owe your share of property tax, compared to money lost paid to a hotel for 20 years.

This is where the scam really traps people. Contracts stipulate who to sell to and then they make it so you can never actually sell it in accordance with the contract. Also that you'll never really own it. So you get stuck making payments to it, repair costs, etc. Or it is prohibitively expensive to terminate the contract.

So yeah, the issue generally isn't with the concept of sharing property with others, its that you get screwed by the contract details"
"People fell for it because it was pitched as an investment, something you ""own"" when it's basically just a vacay rental that's near impossible to get out of"
"Not really unless your timeshare is shit and available. Which many are.. i have one in Mexico. The resort is super nice. The food is awesome. The problem? We can usually only go with other friends and families that also own one because it's so expensive booking Your your own...  does it make sense of you only go once every 3 years? Nope... 
Do i get a 2 bedroom villa with hot tub on a cliff when I take my family? Yup! Do we have a great time and golf on one of the nicest courses in the world for like $80? Yup.  

Basically,  if I didn't own it and wanted to go here and pay full pop... the time share price would be around trip 4.  We've been going for 13 now. 

Just buy it on the 2ndary market... for half what people pay at the resorts presentations.."
"Theirs usually more to it. They usually add some sort of rewards program to it. So if you're not interested in renting the property, you get reward points. You can use those points towards travel to other locations. The points reset every year and you redeem them for more travel.

They try to use a perk like this to reel you in. Cancelling the membership is near impossible."
I still don’t get it. Couldn’t you also go to a hotel in that same area every year?
"The general idea is that you own the timeshare (or at least a portion of it), like owning a house versus renting it. If you spend $X every year renting a hotel room, at the end you have nothing. If you buy a timeshare, though, then you get to use it every year without additional costs and can potentially resell it down the line and make your money back. 

In theory, at least. In reality timeshares have so many fees associated with them that in most cases you're still paying as much every year as if you rented a hotel, and good luck ever selling it."
"We have one that was ""gifted "" to us by my in-laws.  In reality,  it was just easier to give it to us then it was for them to unload it some other way.

That ""gift"" costs 1k per year in maintenance fees. It's only half an hour from where we live and we've used it once in 18 years."
"There are services you can pay to help cancel your timeshare. They charge like a years worth of fees, but they'll unshackle you."
Those services are a scam too
"Not really a scam. They take a cut, but you're paying for their time. You could do it all yourself, but most of the time, you don't have the time or expertise."
Just deed the timeshare back to the company for .01 and walk away. Required no contract knowledge or time.
"I do not own a timeshare nor have I tried an exit company, but based on posts on Reddit and [this John Oliver segment](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd2bbHoVQSM&t=1020s&pp=2AH8B5ACAQ%3D%3D), from what I understand many (if not all) of these exit companies take your money and then ride off into the sunset, without ever getting you out of your timeshare contract"
Surely theres a service for that too then?
It's services all the way down.
"In that case, it would just be a scam."
..yes
"Used to work in a building that had a company doing that, they knew exactly how the original timeshare contracts were made...because the owner of the ""help get out of this scam"" company was the one that sold them the timeshares in the first place, 20 years previously...and they also can't get you out of those contracts, they are just selling them on to other suckers (technically the get you out of the contract, but they are not getting it cancelled), making profit on that then charging you a crazy fee that you are happy to pay to get rid of it. You are literally paying the guy that scammed you to scam you and another person again."
You accepted it
"Well, yes, we accepted it.  We had no idea what owning a condo entailed. We also didn't think (at that time) that it was something we could decline."
"Shit happens.  Maybe a convention happens one year, or your favorite team is a World Series contender so prices go through the roof, etc."
Fixed pricing + you have a condo style home vs a hotel room. It was a big sale for families who wanted separate bedrooms + full kitchen. Before air bnb & the only other real way to get this was via a luxury suite which can get costly for families/generally for all of us.
"You don’t get it because you have sense.   But they sell a “dream” to people who don’t do numbers well.  

Like this: You DESERVE a vacation don’t you?   You work hard, but you do t go?   Why it’s a hassle it costs money, but if you had a place all ready for you, if your weeks were set, if you invested in yourself - your well being - your rest and recovery you would vacation right!   You need to it’s a stressful world.  Lion how wonderful, you can stay in this million dollar room, and only at a fraction of the cost because you share it!    

Now sign here and set yourself up for the rejuvenation you deserve.  

Taxes, fees, hospitality, food all extra in the fine print.

When we went to a presentation it was like $2500 a year and my wife was like that’s amazing for a 2 week vacation!   And then I did the numbers I. The fees, flight, park tickets, and I was like babe, that’s like $15000 at a time, we can’t do 2 week $15000 every year, we wouldn’t afford the travel and theme parks, so now our $6000 room is wasted.   If we think we can afford $6000 a year, we can just book that when we want and it’s not contractually obligated if we don’t use it."
"My in laws have had a time share in Lake Tahoe for 20 years. They paid a price for it back then and now only have to pay a few grand a year for two weeks. They go over Xmas/new years to go skiing. If you wanted to get a hotel you’d pay 500 a night. They have the same room, for the same price, every year. They love it. It’s not for everyone. But they definitely got their moneys worth. They can pass it down to my wife or her brother when they pass."
"You would own those 2 weeks once it’s paid for.  For X# years you would pay (I think) about what you would pay for a vacation  anyway. Then every year for the rest of your life, your kids’ life, your grandkids lives, those 2 weeks in Disneyland, Cancun, or wherever, are paid for, you just have to get there. 

That was the sales pitch anyway."
"Yes, you can.

Timeshares are a great idea, but terrible in reality."
Not if you want the same exact spot every year. You're kinda paying for the ease of use too with a timeshare. If you have the money to spare and you like the exact spot of a timeshare and its amenities then it's worth it. If you are looking at it like a money saver or cheap vacation then it's not worth it
"Hotel is generally a tiny room with 2 beds.  Timeshare is usually resort styles facility with many amenities and you are staying  in a condo style multi bedrooms suite with a full living room, kitchen laundry.  If you are a family of 4 taking 2 kids to Disney world.  The latter is more preferred"
"Hotels don’t usually have full kitchens and large refrigerators, so the theory is you saving money by not eating out 3 meals a day. Also, timeshares are typically much larger than a hotel. Plus you have a washer and dryer, so you can pack less by doing laundry. My dad has several, and they are usually 2 or 3 bedrooms, about twice as large as most hotel rooms."
"Once you buy in, the timeshare cost is controlled. Mine was contractually limited to increasing annual maintenance fees to no more than the CPI.
Hotel prices increase every year per market forces, making the timeshare far more economical over time. After 20 years of ownership I was paying $1,200 maint fee for my timeshare while the cost of a room at the associated hotel had increased to more than $3,000 per week."
Not physically
"You still own the timeshare after you use it. Think of it as a ""regrowing"" asset.

You get say 2 weeks a year to use. In theory, you could use it for a couple years, and then sell it.

You dont have to purchase it over and over again like you would a hotel."
"My wife's grandpa actually got a time share on lake okoboji here in Iowa. I think he started it back in the 80 or early 90s. 

He paid 300$ for the week in this condo. They told him it's his for this week as long as he pays for in a year in advanced. 

Well he always did for his kids and grandkids. Well we still have it and the price hasn't gone up at all. Its still 300$ for this week while other are paying 2k. 

Idk how he got it in writing that the price would not go up. But it hasn't lol"
They get him in the yearly increasing maintenance fees probably.
We do pay a maintenance fee but so does everyone else. I think with maintenance fees for the whole week likes like 800$ but that's still pretty good considering.
"The contracts usually stipulate thr price at signing for the share, but the maintenance fee has to be adjustable.  Costs of maintenance and taxes and staff have to be paid.

They hope there will be turnover every few years to jack up the prices on resold units.

But that's a good deal for a week away."
"Yeah i asked my MIL how that worked and she did say the maintenance fee has gone up over the years. But it's the same for everyone. 

The two neighbors that go to the other time shares the same week we do. Say theirs is the same as ours. They just pay way more for the room."
"Any sane person would immediately notice that everyone would like to use them during the same vacation season, and it could never work out to a simple ""365 / # of participants"".

So you pay for the rent during you stay, and also the upkeep while it's sitting empty and losing money."
"This is what's so sad. The concept is brilliant.

It just never works out that way."
"My parents had a timeshare that they made good use of. Every other year, like clockwork, they went to Vegas for a week and stayed in their timeshare. They saved some money but could only ever vacation in Vegas, but that was fine for them.

Unfortunately, they were in town during the shooting (fortunately nowhere near it) and never got the nerve to go back.

*Somehow*, the company was decent and let them return their timeshare without a penalty.

So, the theory does work for certain circumstances, but as you say, the scummy companies pretty much ruin it."
I heard a podcast where they went into it and it turns out that half the people actually really do like them but those companies aren't the same companies pushing people to buy because they really don't need to. Supposedly there are subreddits where they can tell you the good companies and the bad ones
"I like the view of how you would do a timeshare if you had friends.

Say that a friend comes to you with a really cool idea: you should get a beach house in a nice little beach-town in Mexico. They've done the math and all the calculations. The house would be low maintenance and be cheap to mantain, the community is one you and your friends know and like and are liked in, and the idea is to keep the impact low while still visiting this place. And it'd be large enough that you, your friend, and your larger shared group of friends could stay and each have their room, even an extra couple if needed. The problem is that due to material constructions, challenges, etc. building this place will cost a whopping $600,000 once you've factored in all the payments, construction costs, taxes, and ultimately some projects you both agree would be great for the community and is the minimum you should do to be responsible. It really is a great deal, your dream beach home, with no moral compromise to get it, at a surprisingly low price (a house like this normally goes for a couple million).

But neither of you could pay that much, no matter how good of a deal it is you just can't afford it. You could get a loan, but you'd need at least $400,000 to make it worth your time, and you just can't justify putting that much for a beach house, even if it'd be an awesome one.

But this is why your friend came with you: he thinks that, if you, and 6 other friends put money It's not a small amount, like 20k plus a monthly $100 per person monthly to pay for the loan plus extra costs, but you could afford it. And you'd have an awesome beach house where you guys could get together. Moreover your friend did the math and if you airbnb the house, you can easily make enough money over the year to pay for the costs, which means that after the $20k, you wouldn't have to pay anything unless some major issue happened, and even then insurance should cover most of that.

To leave finances clear and avaiable you all create a company, you all are equal share holders as you all put in equal amounts of money. You also commit to splitting any expenses needed in the future that can't be covered by renting it out. Rather than using airbnb, you guys get a company to rent it out. You give yourself the ability to rent out a room for free at least for 1 month a year (there's enough rooms) and agree that more than that will be paid, as you guys want the airbnb to cover costs, and that needs you letting people rent it out. During low season you all go and hang out there, and during high season you put some rules to ensure that you don't all rent the house fully, the rooms you rent out during this time make the most money to sustain the business later.

Moreover once the home is fully paid, it'll be even easier to keep the whole thing afloat. And if you ever regret it or are done, you can sell your shares of the company, with the benefits it gives, to someone else. Or when you die your kid can inherit that share of the beach-home. So it's not just for life, it's *forever*.

You've got the barebones of a time-share.

Now imagine that you don't have enough money to pony up $20,000 just like that. So instead you think: what if I went for something smaller? That way the initial cost could be as low as $2,000, way more manageable. But this time there wouldn't have enough rooms for everyone. But you use the same rules as before during high season to just make sure that the room doesn't fill up. Now this means that renting it out is not as easy now, because it gets filled up easily. But that's fine because the monthly costs are now way lower, like $20 once you factor everything in. So it's very manageable, like a Netflix guarantee.

A sweet deal still."
"Then I see all of this and realize: hey I could make a business organizing this for other people! I take a small fee, and manage the whole thing, using my experience from before. Not only that, I can get complete strangers and manage all the details myself, way simpler and more direct. So I set the business.



But two problems happen.



The first one is that now I am making a business. See the venture before didn't make money, it just sustained itself, and sometimes would cost something, sometimes very little. But it was fine because what we got was valuable, but now I have to somehow increase those costs to make it worth my fee. But hey, saving the hassle and dealing with that should be worth on its own right?



But then the second problem happens. See most everday people don't understand what a good deal is. They simply assume that whatever they see could be cheaper, but never think through on what compromises and realities are needed.



I remember one roomate I had, when we moved in the old tennats sold me their fully furnished living room, with a massive TV, and the furniture for their bedroom furnishings that included the bed (sans mattress) all already in the home, for just $600. I saw what the furniture was, the TV, the large sectional sofa, the bed was good quality. I did the math and the TV alone would have costed me at least $400 used, and I'd have to move it myself, add the couch and suddenly I was looking at easily $1000. I also realized that the owners were tired to hastling with sellers and just wanted to get rid of it. My roomate wanted to play coy and not take it, the ex-tennats responded by arranging for the furniture to be given out for free on craigslist, I counter-offered to take it at the arranged price because it was a good deal. My roomate scoffed. When I moved out I offered to sell him the living room for $550, I'd keep my bedroom so that was the $50. He didn't like it and said he'd offer me no more than $200 because it was used, I simply responded it was used when I bought it. So I put it in craigslist, the whole thing for $1900 (the TV was the cheapest at $200 but it was old at this point), and I started selling everything. My roomate realized how expensive the couch was. He was shocked when I told him it was going to be at least $900. I had a verbal agreement on the couch for $600, and there was a price to make me go back on my word. He was pissed, but he ended up taking it. That guy was a prick and a bit of a Karen, and honestly I felt a little joy in seeing him realize what a ""clever haggler"" he was.



Point is, in my business I'm dealing with a lot of people like this. People who want to game the system. People who think they can be smarter. People who believe the world is dog-eat-dog and if they aren't fucking someone over, then it \*must\* mean that they're getting fucked (and when this attitude leads to them getting fucked over again and again, they just blame others and double down on the wrong lessons) you know people who needed more hugs when they were kids, and shouldn't have been ferberized. Alas that is life.



So the only way I can make it work is to put all sorts of extreme rules to prevent abuse. Those things that made sense decided among friends? Are now impositions by my company. And in order to make it work with people who are being assholes, and people who are trying to pull lawsuits that are absurd, I have to work with razor thin margins. Which means that in order for the business to work I have to sell more, more, more. The end result is that I have to convince people to take the deal even when they shouldn't, I need to make this work with as many people as I can. I can set it up as a pyramid scheme. This is where the line is, I can either let go of my morals and just scam people, or I can leave the business.



Enough of this, and only shady scammers are left."
"Yeah my parents have one in Orlando Florida, they split it with the other ""half"" of my family and it's nice to get away every other year for a week. We know what we're getting, it's the same two rooms everytime. 

Thankfully the timeshare is actually with the other half of the family and all my parents do is give them half of the yearly fee so we avoid all the bad stuff."
"My grandparents had this exact scenario for around 40 years until the got too frail to travel and then passed away. They spent 2 weeks on the beach in Aruba every year and loved it. After they passed, my uncle inherited it, and sometimes it gets gifted to another family member if he isn't able to go."
"For those curious, the idea of a timeshare is actually shit.

The amount of money spent on a timeshare is usually the EXACT SAME cost as just traveling on your own accord but with the freedom to go whenever you want and wherever you want.

The risk is you start to “miss” the days allotted to you or you don’t have a good option available and now you have to book “around” your time share.

It’s like $8K a year for fees, no airline included.

Never had a time share. I travel quite a bit AND we opt for nicer places, book about a week out (not ideal for pricing) and we have kids. Go wherever we want and kind of decide on a whim. Also we’ve tacked on random days. Still about $6k/year on hotels or air bnb.

never do timeshares."
"Those salespeople are unbelievable. Going to their presentations with a significant other is a wonderful test of whether or not your relationship will work, by the way. 

I went to one with a girlfriend. They broke her within 15 minutes when the manager came in with a sheet of paper and scribbled a bunch of complicated shit about how this is a ""special opportunity"" and she actually pressured me to buy in as a ""commitment to our future"".

F that. So glad I noped out of both that timeshare pitch and that relationship."
I feel even the concept sounds better if you don't think too hard about it. Are you going to want to go to Spring Training every year? Maybe not. Even if you're a big baseball fan maybe you want to go to spring training in Arizona one year. Maybe you check out the World Baseball Classic another year. Sometimes some teams start the year with a series in a warm climate like Puerto Rico. I remember in Last Week Tonight's episode on Timeshares many eventually got bored of the location of the timeshare. I feel like if most people spent enough time thinking about it they probably wouldn't really find it a great idea even before they realized how hard they are to get rid of.
"I never understood timeshares. I think, at best, you are prepaying for use of a condo. It seems just as useful to pay a hotel."
"I mostly agree, but even if you take away the predatory aspect of it, there’s still the matter of demand not being equal all year round. Almost everyone wants roughly the same time period based on location due to seasonal activities (skiing, warm weather in winter, etc.), so by nature most people will get stuck with a suboptimal timeslot."
"I’m currently working on launching this (vacation club) at my project in Phuket.  Thank you for perfecting designing the concept, benefit - and bullshit that comes with it.  This is exactly what I’ve managed to avoid.  Now just getting past that stigma…"
But that just sounds like a hotel
I don't understand how it's wonderful though. They cost thousands that you could just use over time to go wherever you want instead.
Behold: blackout dates
"Plus... there are 200 other people who have the same plan that you do. And then 20 that have a better plan that cost more. And those 20 get to chose whatever weekend they want Mostly... and you have to take what is left. And then there are 4 or 5 who pay a lot more and have the BEST plan. And they actually get to pick any weekend they want. And they ALWAYS pick the two weeks of spring training. Along with a few air BNB folks who own a few of the top plans. And because of this, you will never get to pick a ""blacked out"" date. And the only time you actually WILL ever get to chose from are right in the middle of the worst time of the year to stay. But they sure sold you on getting to come stay every year for spring training. 
And in the states they are hugely common in... because of lobbying by the corps that own the time share companies... they are almost iron clad contracts and incredibly difficult and costly to get out of. (most of the companies that get you OUT of timeshares... are also owned by the over companies that SELL timeshares) 

And in a lot of those states, yes... your children CAN be forced to pay for them after you die. There are procedures they can go through that will take a hell of a lot of time and probably money... and may not work the first time or two they do them. 


They are horrible for 99% of the people who get them. 

I used to joke that if I didnt like my kids or their spouses, I would get a time share late in life and leave it to them. But then, I thought... what kind of asshole would do that, also, with my luck I would be given a dose of magic medicine that made me live for ever. LOL"
I love my timeshare for the reasons you mentioned.
"There was time in which if you only ever wanted to vacation in the same place at the same time every year, they may have made sense. One of my former bosses had a timeshare on Hilton Head Island, and he always took off the same week in August to go there and play golf for a week. It probably made sense for him.

This was before all that points trading bullshit they came up with later. So he probably did save money over booking a resort there every year, even with the maintenance fees."
"There were some loopholes back in the day too, I know one of my family members had several in the mid 80's to early 90's that were owned by his corporation and  probably used on one side as a listed asset and a write off at tax time because they were in locations where shareholder meetings took place."
"Yep. This is why the disney world timeshares actually make sense for some, plus they are probably easier to sell off eventually too."
"In theory it is co-owning a vacation property.


2 friends owning a vacation property together? Perfect sense. Neither loses much utility because they only use it 2-10 weeks out of the year so just some minor schedule adjustments and you can save 1/2 the cost,


3 friends? Fine. 5? ok. 10? Scheduling would be a pain. But what if it was 12 and 2 places. Now you save a lot money and can get a decent schedule. 


Now expand that to thousands of people across 100 rooms in a hotel. Not terrible in theory. 



But now it’s gotta be run by a business since you need investors to build the big property and can’t find 100 friends. Well it’s a business so you gotta make the most money, so you sell maximum coverage. Now it is 52 people with 1 week each per room! To buy the property you agree to pay annually for upkeep and management. 

Scheduling now sucks. Lots of black out dates. Make more money charging premiums to over come that. 

You’re a management company now so raise the annual dues to get more money. 

Someone wants to back out now? Too late no one wants to buy into a high fee property with weird black out dates. Can’t get out of the contract.




That’s kinda their inception to bastardized late stage capitalism current existence.


People buy into it still because they just get sold on the idea of a share in a vacation property, which at face value a fine idea."
"This was an excellent description—thank you for taking the time!! And yeah, great in concept, fucked in actuality like most things in capitalism"
Oh I guess communism works so well then yeah?
"My uncle, who is well-off, has a timeshare in Tahoe.

His justification is that, ""No matter what happens. I know from december 11th to the 15th, i can have all my family over to the cabin in Tahoe.""

Which seems like a really long way to just get an airbnb whenever/where ever you want without having the commitment of a time share."
"Kids' reactions the first year: ""Cool!""

2nd year: ""Can we go to Disneyland instead?""

3rd year: ""Do we have to, dad? I'm getting tired of the cabin.""

4th and later years: ""Ugh..."" (sulk the entire time)"
My parents used to rent some other dummies time share from them in Florida every year growing up that's about the closest I've ever seen to that
"The idea is you buy a portion of a home or condo or whatever for part of each year, then it's yours for those weeks or months each year. ""What's the point of owning a vacation home if it's empty most of the year?"" goes the spiel.

Not for me, thanks."
"Ahhhh, so yeah it’s more like an actual home vs a hotel and someone else takes care of it the rest of the time, I guess."
"It's basically owning property overseas that you can visit for way cheaper than a standard hotel and it the end of it you have a tangible asset.

The issue is that once you're in you can never get out."
"Imagine a 2 bed flat in a resort city, that costs 100k. The time share sells the same flat to 10 people for 10k/each. You technically own a 10% share of the flat and every time you want to go on holiday there, you have to agree with the rest of the ""owners"".


You can imagine how difficult this can be. It takes ages for a family of 5 to decide what to order for dinner, imagine trying to book 2 weeks in the summer and have 9 ""partners"" agree with the timing of your booking.

By the way feel free to correct me, I am not an expert."
They can make sense if you always want to go to the same place for vacation.
"My parents got 2 weeks at Vail in a 2 bedroom basement unit. It was $3,000 I think and the maintenance fees each year were about $100-175 a year over the course of my childhood. You could trade it for a week somewhere else for about the same. My wife and I spent a week on Eagle Beach in Aruba for our honeymoon and my parents spent $140 to give us that gift. 

Despite it being not a great unit we got 2 weeks of skiing each year at a world-class resort and we were close enough to walk to the lift in our ski boots. I started skiing when I was 2 and last time I went I was 22, so that's 20 years of skiing plus whatever my parents got before and after then. Now that they are older they just trade both weeks when they travel. It's a bit more, but still cheaper than 7 nights hotel.

I'm sure most deals are crappy, but they don't regret this one one bit."
"It's the commercial equivalent of buying a condo with some friends in a cool location -- you own a share of a specific room/condo/apartment/whatever, and you pay your share of the ""HOA fees"" every month/year. When you sign up, you pick the days/weeks each year you want to reserve the place for. If you want to move that around, there's a system to trade your week with others for a small fee. There's also a system where you can trade _places_ with someone who has a share at some other place.

Sketchy business people quickly figured out that if you make the ""trading"" part complex enough while making it sound like a _really good deal_, a lot of people will fall for it and they get to keep all the excess money people spend without using their timeshare.

There are actually a few legitimate ones left, despite the vast majority being a scam. And even the kinda-scammy ones can be ok if you actually just find a place you want to stay for the same week/month/whatever each year and don't plan on using any of the trading/flexibility parts."
"in theory it makes sense. You want a vacation home. You only use it 2 weeks a year. Why pay for it 52 weeks a year? share it with 26 other people and everyone gets it for 2 weeks.

When you layer in the complexity of everyone wanting to go at the same time, legal liabilities and insurance, and good old fashioned corporate greed it gets more complicated."
"I think there's definitely a benefit if you can afford to and have the time to take a week or more vacation every year. If you're already doing that, a timeshare would be a good idea. Especially one like Hilton's with the points based system. 

The whole timeshare idea operates on selling you ""property"" that you can use for a set amount of time. So you buy a week in Florida, 2 weeks in Hawaii, etc for an upfront fee. They tell you that you ""own"" part of that property now, and as an owner you and all the other owners are responsible for paying the maintenance and property taxes every year. Some of these companies even issue a special ""deed"" to show you are an owner. But it's really the company passing all the burdens of being an owner onto you and keeping all the benefits for themselves.

Imagine having a roommate in your house. You tell him since he's living there now, you're going to give him some ownership of the house. So he gives you 20k as a payment, and then starts paying his share of property taxes, insurance, repairs, etc. Then in 10 years you decide you want to move away so you sell the house. Does your roommate get his 20k back? Do you give him part of the profit that you made? Nope. You tell him ""hey I sold the house that surrounds your room, so someone else is going to live with you now, have fun"", and take your money to your new house so you can do the scam all over again with someone else."
"Like every other thing, something starts out good and the predators get into it and spoil it for everyone. I have owned two timeshares and both were very good because I did the research and only bought with major reputable chains, at places where we go every year anyway, and have divestment clauses for when you want to sell out. What I paid in total was far less than hotel rooms. 
Big rule: never buy from the salesman. Visit the resort, listen to their spiel but be strong and walk away, buy from an individual wanting to sell theirs. You'll save about half the buy in price.

saved me a ton of money over hotel prices."
I don’t either lol

"""That's a picture of my vacation in Muncie.""  

""You went on a vacation and you chose Muncie, Indiana?""  

""Yeah. My wife and I have a timeshare.""  

""In Muncie??""  

""Tom. Muncie is a lovely city."""
"And we can upgrade to Gary, Indiana!"
The selling point for places like that is they are cheaper and you can “trade” for weeks in more expensive places.  I knew someone that was convinced this was a big brain trick.  Made my head hurt.
My grandparents lol. But our family has always been big into trips to Tablerock Lake. Fantastic lake BTW. 1000x better than Ozarks.
"Extended family and ours rented an Air BnB at Table Rock Lake and really enjoyed it.  I was under the impression that was included in the ""Ozarks"" umbrella.  Am I wrong?

By the way: I will NEVER allow a cousin to compel the entire 27-person large group to buy expensive-ass tickets to the Branson Belle river boat (lake boat?) show.  Food fucking sucked, show was awful, and the boat was fucking *dry*.  As awful as it was and I couldn't even get a goddamn drink?  Fuck that stupid goddamn boat.

Beautiful lake and we had a blast, though.  Other than the 2 hours I was stuck on that god forsaken boat."
Tablerock and Ozarks are separate lakes but they're both in the Ozarks area

"I agree — Ozarks are, well, the ozarks"
"Oh god, Missourians LOVE Branson tho. As a Kansas who now lives in Missouri (KCMO), this is an appalling idea to me but Missourians love their weird dirty lakes."
[deleted]
"Yeah it’s a cesspool. But I’m immunocompromised so there’s very few bodies of water I feel comfortable in. The opposite of any fucking lake, tho I’ve been in the Great Lakes and some beautiful lakes in Minnesota. They just were definitely cleaner — esp the Great Lakes!

The ocean, when it’s clear and I can see through it. Sure, it’s prolly just as fucking dirty but it’s pretty and if that’s what kills me — the fucking OCEAN?! and not the actually diagnoses I have (many many diagnoses), well, then I’ll remind myself the universe is one big fucking joke and laugh my way to the end, knowing the beautiful ocean was the last thing I saw, felt, experienced."
"Man, there are good times to be had in Branson like... a couple times. I can't imagine thinking, ""wow, I can't wait to come back year after year"""
"Yeah we went to Branson for a week, had fun. Got to go zorbing! 

But no burning desire to go back lol"

"I'll never forget the time wife and I got tricked into attending a timeshare meeting. 

Everything about it just screamed GIVE US MONEY!!!! They really made it feel like we had no choice but I was very strict and told them ""I have no money, I'm only here for the free tickets you guys promised us"" over and over again. 

Eventually they had to get their fucking manager to deal with us 😂"
"They got me good and drunk and I got a free off road atv trip out of it. Though my wife almost bought into it, for which I have since teased her mercilessly"
"My husband and I went. We were all “no one can con us” before going. And that’s how he learned very early in the marriage that I can easily be conned. Thankfully he cannot, so we don’t own a timeshare. (Although I’ve still wasted money on every sob story that comes along because I’m a sucker.)"

That sounds life threatening. I hope someone gullible can help you right away.

Thanks for the laugh! Tell me how those children won’t have Christmas and I’m your girl.
How many PMs have you gotten asking for money?
"This is why I won't take my wife with me when it's time to buy a car, it'll cost me extra money.  She's also easily conned, god help me my worst nightmare is what'll happen if I die first."
Did you get the free tickets?
Yup!
"> Eventually they had to get their fucking manager to deal with us 😂

Had a similar situation. We were on vacation. Guy asked to come to one of these meetings, promising free tickets. We told him, ""We're not buying anything. We're only going to go for the free tickets."" He said that was fine.

We get there. Do pretty much what you did, which is say, ""We're not spending money. We're just here for the free tickets."" Then had the person we were assigned to get very belligerent with us, and target my wife specifically, claiming we were leeches and that we were lying because they never would've encouraged people to come just for the free tickets.

After the second time he said something very aggressive at my wife, the manager on duty seemed to notice that my face, posture, and tone of voice were all consistent with 'murder', and simultaneously threw tickets at us and banned us from future meetings."
"I went to one with my wife in Vegas because they were offering tickets to a show we had planned to get tickets for anyway. It was an hour on a Saturday morning. We showed up, very fancy suite, I flat out said up front “I’m not buying anything today.” It was like five sales people and just me and my wife. They gave us a bunch of mimosas and chocolate covered strawberries. I think they realized there was no possibility of us buying so we just shot the shit with them for the remaining time and got our tickets. I probably wouldn’t do it again but it wasn’t horrible. Guess we got lucky though listening to other stories."
"Yes Vegas my gf and I got a free helicopter tour and 3nights and 2 days at a resort 

Only screwy side was a deposit 100$ for resort fees but we got it refundable 

Just read the fine print and do not let them bully your or intimidate


They tried to emasculate me saying my gf makes more money  and she deserves it my gf was almost begging me to buy in but I ain’t no fucktard 

Even if it let us to breaking up"
"I got tricked into it too while on vacation.  ""Hey, come get breakfast, and listen to a sales pitch and get free tickets"".  So, I had the breakfast and listened to a pitch and felt it wasn't going to end and decided if rather just continue my vacation as planned and told them rather sternly that I'm leaving.  So I did."
"My parents would take advantage of time share meetings.  They never bought into one, they never had any intention of buying into one, we would just go to take advantage of all the free stuff during the meetings. We lived near Wisconsin Dells so time share meetings were basically free trips to one of the water parks for me and my ""sister"" (whichever friend I brought with) while my parents indulged in free food and booze during the meetings."
"For several years after we had kids our vacations were attending these sales meetings.

After the first couple we figured out how to cut the sales pitches short. Just flat out tell them we have no money and that this is the 4th we've attended in the last 6 months."
And now there's the scams to get you out of your timeshare.
Aren't the Cartels doing this from Mexico now?
"I don't know about that, but I hear one guy that does them on the radio even after he and his company were sued and exposed as another scam."
"Absolutely timeshares. I get that a vacation property sounds nice to people, but at this point how could anyone not know what a scam they are?"
"You know the saying “there’s a sucker born every minute”?


So, it’s a little cynical but it’s true…ish.

You might know what timeshares are, but what about the 17 year old waitress at your favorite restaurant? Or the 21 year old college student? Or the newly weds looking for a  place to vacation?


Scams like this work because there’s no instruction guide to life, no pamphlet of information we all get. Some people unfortunately just don’t know. We all don’t know stuff"
"Or the physical therapist who doesn't have a big online presence.   The Timeshare places make it sound like the greatest deal ever.

Sidenote, I don't think the Marriott or Hilton timeshares are as bad as the rest...not amazing deals, but not fraud.

Buddy's parents were glad that post COVID they could stay at various Hilton related places without paying extra due to demand."
"Oh, there are people who don’t know and desperately want to believe."
"I blame the unknown you have to educate people especially the rich elderly 

Because timeshare people DO NOT CARE IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING 

If you see people buying timeshares they are in on it 

Once we denied the timeshare we just so happened to hear a couple scream in joy to signing one (never cringe so bad in my life)"
"""You won't see us getting scammed!

""No way!""

Mac and Dennis buy a timeshare."
"My mother had 2 time  shares in Vail for decades . We would go every year. She died and my daughter inherited both of them. Now the grandkids go. (If you are unable to go, the company rents it out for you. We have never had to do this.) It's great ! For us it is not a scam. "
I'm sure like 50 years ago it was less scummy.
They have switched it now for the ones you don't actually own the property but kinda rent it. Vacation clubs. Same stupid scam.
"I have a friend who owns 3! She has no kids but her nieces and nephews have already asked her not to will them to them. No one wants someone else’s timeshare.Nothing like spending thousands plus yearly taxes and maintenance fees to occupy a small unit for one week each year.Many years ago my parents attended a timeshare presentation. My dad started asking some questions that made the salesman uncomfortable. Rather than respond, he escorted my parents out."
My family has a small little timeshare and we love it. It's pretty much all west coast locations and no blackouts. We use it about 3 times a year and give a trip to family members once a year.
"This is the thing. Timeshares can be amazing for a very small subset of the population. Ive looked into them, never bought, but the math has made sense in a few cases based on how often we travel to a few places. Yet, the issue is always if we will still want to go to those places in a few years let alone a decade from now. That’s the issue, timeshares can’t easily be sold as nobody wants them, and nowadays the company’s got smart and screw you over if you try to sell resell by taking away benefits"
"A scam has to be lying to the customer or 'victim' most people don't read the documents that are signing. I agree there are predatorial timeshares out there and maybe a majority of them are. I am sure my wife and I will want to travel to Hawaii in a few years or decades. 

Ours is also a limit of 25 years so it will end. I know a lot of them do not though."
"I signed up for one in Hawaii, I've gone the last 4 years.  The contract is for 10 years and the yearly maintenance fees.  Once 10 year loan is up, you just pay the maintenance.

This is Marriot vacation club and they have a lot of properties in the US/EU.  My GF and I travel at least twice a year and sometimes 3.  We're super flexible with dates so it makes sense.  

I think for people with kids who can only travel in the same time frames that most people who have kids makes it difficult given the demand, but if you're flexible you can get reliable booking"
My first thought. Second is MLM's.
"Have to say… I was completely against one. But my s.o. bought through Westin (now Marriot) and it’s a point system that gets us a month in Cancun in a 1 bed villa per year. That’s our home resort, but have also used it in Cabo, Maui, Oahu, Bahamas, Florida and etc. Would I have purchased it? Never. Do I enjoy vacationing with it? 1,000%. Do we go to the owner update meetings everytime we vacation? Yes, they pay us $300 to do so. Will we ever buy more points from said meetings? Nope. We are happy and just say we have more points for vacationing than PTO and they can’t fight that."
"Maaaaan I narrowly escaped this in Vegas once. After wasting the whole day trying to politely escape the sales pitch, and finally leaving. They go behind my back and get my wife to sign. . . They explained every single document except one, they tried to slyly sneak that one into the pile. 

I pulled it out later and found out we had 3 days to cancel. Shut that shit down quick!"
I know two people who have 3-4 timeshares each. Needless to say (but here I go) they aren’t very bright and they now resent the properties and don’t even use them. Yet they burn the money away.
"""I just wanna go someplace where we know somebody who can plug us into the social pipeline"""
"Oh this! The old *""you can't afford NOT to go on vacation!*""  Think John Oliver did a segment on it last year."
"John Oliver's bit on timeshares was done so well. It was very funny, but also very informative and showed what a massive scam it is."
Hilton Grand Vacations is so bad
These always sounded horrible to me. Never understood them.
"Just a couple of years ago, someone I know really wanted to get a timeshare. It would have wrecked her financially (she was barely getting by to begin with). It took a LOT of effort for me to get through to her. Some people are desperate to believe that things that sound too good really can be true. (She didn’t get the timeshare, and later thanked me for saving her from it.)"
Great answer. Mind boggling.
"I don’t even know what a timeshare is, such an outdated thing lol"
"Jesus, my neighbor was talking about this. She LIVES in Florida and has timeshare IN Florida. Why?

She's like, ""you can stay there anytime you want because I never go. Well, you do have to pay for the transfer fee. It's only $199. And there's just a few other fees. No more than a few hundred extra. Probably."".

Yeah, no thanks."
This is the one I thought of first. It's such a well known scam it's basically a punchline at this point. How is there still anyone remaining to still be fooled?
Bruh the stories I’ve heard from my lady who works as a senior closer for a timeshare company….
"Man, a few years ago John Oliver did an episode on time shares and I did not realize how bad it was. When you buy one your kids, grand kids, great grand kids and so on will have to deal with it. 

Then there's a whole nother scam that claims to help you get out of timeshares....it's a real scummy business."
"On a family vacation in the UK in the 80s we went along to a presentation at an old manor house that was being converted into Timeshare units. We got a guided tour of the historic manor, got to look at all the facilities, had a decent buffet lunch, and then at the end when they pulled out the paperwork my parents said ""Sorry, we're from Australia so we'd never use it"" and we walked out like absolute savages."
"I did one of those bc they offered a $200 gift card to a fancy restaurant in the area and it was 'only an hour'. It in fact was like 3 hours. The salesman dragged out the tour of the property. Then, the manager comes to talk numbers. That didn't work so the manager went to get 'the closer'. The whole process was to wear me down to buy something. They legit went from $1000 to $150/yr while adding a bunch of perks to their membership program. After many NOs from me, they finally gave in and gave me the gift card. 

The meal was nice and it being free was awesome, but the whole process was like dragging me through sand."
"Yes. We had an elderly relative who was in a timeshare but passed away. She used to take us on holiday on these timeshares because there were multiple resorts you could choose. So we already had some booked in before she died. The timeshare company were actively trying to make the next of kin pay for the continuation and upkeep of it. We asked about the ones that were already booked that were essentially paid for but to use them we would have to agree to another 50 years of payments or something. They weren't concerned that their customer had died, just concerned with who they were going to continue fleecing."
"Always a ripoff if you buy them directly, because they use markup on the direct sales to recoup the costs they incur in promotion/sales.

  
Always a ripoff if you just ain't going to use them, and you would never recoup the costs trying to sell it.

That being said, I have a few friends and family who have had them paid off for years and use them every year who have no complaints. And, when they have excess, they offer it up to friends and family to use."
"We got suckered into timeshares 2 years ago. First they draw you in by pretending you've won a free holiday, then they sit you down and tell you how your dream of vacationing overseas (something we can never afford to do) is within reach for a small payment every month.

I phoned and cancelled the next morning once I'd come to my senses, but man, their sales people are just so good."
"I know two people who have a good, working timeshare. One is a cabin near a ski resort, once is a city spa.

Both have fixed one week times to use the place per year, and the only costs are the annual dues that cost less than the hotel/cabin would cost without the timeshare.

They are owned by people that live their lives with a very steady routine, so they will, without fail, use their vacation days on said weeks.

And these are the kind of people who, this specific type of timeshare, is worth it. To nearly 99.9999999% of the rest of humanity, THEY ARE NOT WORTH IT."
"I remember a friend of mine years ago who just got married and they didn't have enough money to afford a car, but they were so proud that they got a Time Share in Colorado.  It was only $75 per month and they could use it for three days a year, during the month of March, and only on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.  They had that contract for three years, never used it, and when they tried to stop it they found out they were locked into a five year commitment."
"First time I went to Vegas, right after we check in to the hotel and get ready to hit the strip my friend starts taking to this guy in the hotel lobby trying to sell him a time share. 

My friend is just standing there hearing this dude out for fifteen minutes before I'm finally like ""Paul, let's get out of here. You don't want to buy a timeshare"""
People paying thousands of dollars to get rid of their timeshare. We just donated ours to charity and got a tax write-off.
Getting OUT of them too. Just as much a scam as buying one in the first place. John Oliver did a whole bit on it.
"Hey, I have a timeshare, lol. They’ve changed since the days my parents have to go to some presentation in the middle of a vacation.

At least mine is different, anyway. I get points instead of time, and it’s an inheritable asset in a tourist spot. Not some random in-land Florida timeshare far away from anything touristy."
"Honestly one of the less moronic things to fall for

I get the concept... You could even make a version that isn't a scam if you wanted. It's just run by slimeballs"
"but I love to take their free or cheap stuff.  For years it was the only way I could afford to vacation. Just last year my daughter & I went to Cabo for a getaway and got lured into timeshare offer with food, drink and golf at a very exclusive, private resort.  Heck yeah!!  Spent an hour touring properties, an hour saying no and off to amazing day. Wasn't planned and turned into the highlight of our trip."
My parents have one and it's crazy how impossible they are to get rid of. Its the one inheritance you can give to ruin someone's life.
"I went to a presentation once because they were promising a $500 gift card either if you bought one or didn’t buy one. I was in dire need of a set of new tires. 

I survived although the pressure was brutal. The attractive sales lady smoked like a chimney and her car smelled like a 70’s NYC dive bar. 

I got my $500 gift card. I’ve even signed up for more but for some reason they don’t call me."
"Time shares are really only scams if you go in with strangers . But lowkey if you did a time share with people you know well, it’s actually worth it … too bad they’re way too costly due entirely to the salespeople"
"My wife and I bought into a timeshare company and… we like it. We bought the smallest package they were offering and refuse to spend any more money with them (oh, they try), but for what we use it for it’s perfect."
"Oh, god....I worked with a woman who was in her early 60s that got talked into buying one at a resort hotel that's only a couple of miles from her house. She and her sister lived together and each put up 20K to get free weekend hotel rooms every week for the rest of their lives, as long as the hotel isn't sold out that weekend. It's in Phoenix, so of course it's sold out every weekend throughout the fall and winter when then temperature drops and the snowbirds are in town. 

Sorry, Wanda, you're a sweetheart and make great cookies and all, but you're an idiot."
This REALLY depends on your situation. My wife and I have had ours for years and use it all the time. I wouldn’t consider any besides Hilton or Marriott but we take four or five vacations a year and it’s a great deal for us.
"They weren't, once upon a time. My grandparents have had a timeshare in Hawaii since the early 90s and it's been huge for them.

But these days they seem to be absolutely *awful*."
"I have an aunt who is one of the microscopic few who actually turns a profit on timeshares.

She has one specific resort that she loves, and she knows it's popular with particular international communities who don't want to buy in permanently. She has enough consecutive weeks between two units that she spends 3-5 months there in the winter and only changes units once. Otherwise she has anywhere from 3-6 other units available for rent at any given time. Her expense is the maintenance fee, and she just adds that to the price for the renter. Usual rent is $3k-$5k for the week depending on how close to Christmas/New Year's it is. Maintenance is like $600 per unit per week. It's become her own little fiefdom.

When some folks sell, they do everything they can to *not* sell to her. She finds ways to buy them anyway. Other folks will think she's knowledgeable about the property and they'll ask her to list it for them. Which she will deliberately do badly so no offers come in, and then she can make a lowball of her own."
"Oh my God! I have a sister-in-law who has multiple timeshares! She's always trying to rent them or trade them. It's absolutely wild! At least one of the companies has told her if she doesn't pay her unit off her ""heirs"" will be responsible for the debt to try to get her to pay more than whatever she already is paying monthly."
"Husband and I will go to a timeshare thing every once in a while so we can walk away with the 4 day cruise. Never bought anything, get a heavily discounted trip. It's worth it to listen to them yammer away for a couple hours."
My brother owns nit one but two. So he can pass them down to his two sons. 🤦🏻‍♀️
"I love the timeshare game. Go to their presentation and sit through them lying. You get free hotel rooms. It's normally the really nice suites too. If you can keep saying ""no"" you should try it."
These *can* be rockin' deals on the second-hand market. I'm close friends with somebody who bought one second-hand in 2021 for $5000. She now has two weeks in Cancun for *$800 CAD / year.*
"That's because not all timeshares are a scam.

I have a week at the base of a popular ski lodge in Colorado, 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, full kitchen - I pay $930 for the week, including maintenance fees. If I were to try to rent an equivalent place, I may end up paying $700 a night.

I also have a week on an island off the coast of Florida, it's $860 for the week, including maintenance fees. This one is a 2 bed, 2 bath, full kitchen, waterfront and includes dock space for the boat. I'd pay $700 for the dock space for the week alone. 

Some timeshares are scams, some are not. I can either use them myself, or rent them for $3,500 to $5,000 a week each - that's below market, because the owners typically rent to each other as a courtesy. If I rent to a random person, I could easily rent for more.

My family has owned both since the early 80's, so we're well into the time frame when they promise that being an owner will pay off.

Neither were part of large corporations when they were built, and still aren't today. They're privately owned, and managed, by a collective of the owners."
"You’ve had good experiences because like you said, they are small and privately operated. I know people who bought into similar timeshares and actually really enjoy them. That was the original purpose of them.

The problem is the big corporations and hotel chains who operate time shares know how to suck the money out of people. Those are the bad ones."
"Exactly my point.

It's not timeshares that are a scam, it's big businesses tricking people. There is nothing inherently scammy about a timeshare - it all comes down to the contract, and not being a moron."
The problem is there aren’t very many like yours anymore. The vast majority are the big corporations with high pressure sales who are looking to squeeze out every dollar they can.
Only the elderly fall for it
"Influencer created products and influencer based events.

"In the same vein, influencer ""projects."" People invested millions in Cryptozoo, even tho Logan Paul has a terrible track record."

"Logan and Mr Beast are all into getting in on early funding for crypto things and then selling as soon as things go public.

I think Jake Paul is going to be indicted in a massive doping scandal relatively soon.
"No, that deal is done, he got paid and we never see him boxing again"
"Who's going to hold him accountable? It's not like he does olympic boxing, what he does is more akin to wrestling. And everyone knows wrestlers are juiced to the gills and essentially paid actors."
I have a feeling one of the Paul brothers will end up in politics at the end of their days
"How was the Paul/Tyson fight a scam? People were promised a boxing match between the two, and that's what they got. I saw some of it on Netflix, didn't have to pay or anything, so I'm not sure how it would be a scam. 

Is it because the fight is fake? I just assume any big event like that is pre-coordinated and they're basically actors putting on a show."

I googled Lunchly and it looks like a lunch box for kids. What’s the scam here?
"Lunchly isnt a scam, so much as the creator is the scammer. Lunchly is a lunchable knockoff. Mr Beast and Logan Paul market heavily to their minor age audience their lunchables, candy bars and coconut water."
"In this definition, all companies are scammers. You can hate Jake Paul all you want, but this is how you push products and make money in the world."
"Sorry, was giving background on the people. Logan Paul literally has a crypto scam in Cryptozoo and Mr Beast doesnt pay his philanthropy bills."
"It's not a scam now, but they have said their goal is to sell directly to schools. So they're effectively using kids as their middleman to hype up demand for schools to commit to long-term contracts at high prices for shitty product (what they're selling for now is not what a nationwide rollout of daily school lunches would cost). 

Also there's been a ton of reports of mouldy product."
"The way I see it is that it’s a scam because by the numbers, yes, Lunchly is “healthier” than a lunchable by a negligible amount, but costs at least $1.00 more. 

Both are not healthy lunch options, but Lunchly has the influencer name branding to sell to an impressionable audience and charge more as a result."
"It's not a scam. People on this website just label everything they don't like as a scam.

That being said, Lunchly is still an extremely shitty product"
"Well, there's the possible mold: https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedrama/comments/1gbe5d6/another_streamer_has_found_mold_in_lunchly/"

"Paul and Tyson fight was such a dissapointment. I don't care if it was staged or Mike was in bad condition, this fight should have never happen in the 1st place, Mike should not be reduced to a clown that boosts Pauls ego, hype and fight record, so he can sell more shitty food products to kids."

he also got paid. sources vary and the actual contract is confidential, but somewhere between 20-40 million

he had a lot of money at one point in time but he's gone through almost of all of it. the reason he agreed to take the fight is because he's already proved everything he had to prove, he thought it would be fun to get in the ring again, and the purse was fucking colossal"

Amway
Any pyramid scheme. I can’t believe when I see otherwise intelligent people selling amway or even scentsy which I don’t know much about but still. You could earn so much more if you just spent the same amount of time at a part time job.
"Or when they refer to themselves as ""entrepreneurs"" or ""small business owners"""
"I met someone who introduced themselves as a small business owner and since I have an MBA and work in marketing, I was genuinely interested in their work. And then they said more…and I quickly went from interested to oh noooo. They were describing a pyramid scheme, and I got out of there as quickly as I possibly could."
There’s still 5% of people who do make money off that. My cousin is one of those. But then I hate her because he is taking advantage of people.
"Of course, that’s what makes pyramid schemes kinda gross."
"I think she entered into it as a skeptic. She had just lost her job and needed a side gig. But then, when she got lucky with it, I do believe she is now a true believer. That it is actually is an engine for change in peoples lives and not a disgusting pyamrid scheme."
You just said that 5% of people make money.
Yes. But she denies reality now.
"Any MLM, really."

"When I was a kid, I confused Amway and Amtrak. I was like.. why the fuck would people think selling train tickets is a scam? They're so stupid."
"I had a ""friend"" try to recuit me to one. When I didn't join I haven't heard from him since. I knew it was some BS when I could not be transparent to anyone about the program."
"I know someone personally who made a ton of money selling Amway stuff. They live for it and use all the Amway stuff. But they made so much by also being extremely frugal and cutting costs in any way they could for years. I believe they also had normal jobs too.

I used to be close friends with their kids but the husband kept calling and trying to push my dad into buying more and selling more Amway stuff to the point where it was causing a strain in my parents marriage."
"I'm related to someone in the very top levels. I've seen them at their job, which used to be traveling around the world telling people how rich Amway had made them. I haven't talked to them in decades, but they are still EXTREMELY rich and have made multi-generational wealth with it. They have so many people underneath them making a bunch of money that they'll never have to worry about it again. Three generations are taken care of so far, none of them will ever have to work. 

I watched them buy a house for $760k in cash when that was still a lot of money. They gave it away as a gift. 

It may not be possible to get rich now, but there damn sure are a lot of people that have already done so."
"All the money gets funnelled to the top so unless you are at the top, you won't make much off it while spending so much time in it"
Yeah that's for sure. Back in the 90s they were making $6 million a year minimum from the people under them. They didn't sell anything as far as I remember.  They literally traveled the world telling people how rich they were and that if they just signed up and worked hard they could be where they were at before too long. I don't know how they live with themselves. They're some of the most disgusting people I've ever met. They're still rich as fuck too. It's so wild
Back in the 80s I was watching an interview with a successful business man. The interviewer asked what this person would do to make money if he wasn’t in real estate. The guy replied I’d sell Amway. That guy was Donald Trump.
death death death
Exactly... is there anyone else buying this? The last time I heard about them was like 20 years ago.

"Or she's hourly/salaried. I was part of a MLM several years ago that was started and based locally to me (I got out before it came out that vendors were never paid and the company was on the brink of bankruptcy before it was bought out by another company).

While I was still in it, we had a local convention and we had the opportunity to tour the factory/warehouse. They had employees that were paid hourly and were ineligible to sell the product, and I believe the C suite also received a salary rather than being at the top of the uplines."

"Hmmmm, is that a good thing? Other than for your mom?"
Prosperity Gospel Preachers
Specifically Joel Osteen and his ilk. They're why we should be taxing performative mega-churches like they live off of.
When Houston flooded he locked his mega church so no one could go in to seek shelter. I mean... even Mattress Mack opened his furniture store to let people sleep in his brand new beds to shelter them when their homes were flooded. Osteen is scum.
That's what turned my mom off him. She was really great with him and read his books and then the moment he needed to practice what he preached she saw him for who he was.
He finally relented after being called out on social media. Fucker lied about flooding in his church.. ppl who lived nearby went and showed that it wasn't. It was the lower portions of the parking garage. (He didn't want the  poors in his church)
"I didn’t know this, but it also doesn’t surprise me. He’s garbage."
"Having worked several Tornados, I will say that he did the right thing.  During the 2013 Tornadoes that hit Oklahoma we had about fifty people in our church building.  In the span of an hour we had several doors kicked in so they could see what was behind locked doors, we had several inside windows smashed, some people let their dogs dump in the auditorium, and a lot of general destruction.  Then a few of them came back a week later and tried to sue us for some petty reasons.  People are horrible in these situations"
"As someone who has been ordained and helped run a church, and also worked through several natural disasters, I beg to differ. Yes, some people suck. But Christ calls His followers to help _anyway_, and the idea that you'd have the ability to help people in need but refuse to do so because some might take advantage is _incredibly un-Christlike_.

A Christian making this decision for their privately-owned hotel would deserve some side-eye; someone claiming to be a teacher of the Word of God deciding not to help because some people are shitty -- and then lying about it -- deserves shunning."
">and the idea that you'd have the ability to help people in need but refuse to do so because some might take advantage is incredibly un-Christlike.

No one said that we did not help, however there is a difference between what one can do to help and what someone else thinks they should do to help."
Joel Osteen didn't help. That was the subject. And he definitely could have opened his church -- as evidenced by the fact that he eventually did once he got enough bad PR and got caught lying.
"I understand some people are shitty. On the flip side, there are families and people who are not shitty. As a preacher, shouldn't you love thy neighbor? Where is the love when thy neighbor needs serious help? Instead, he's living comfortably in his multi-million dollar mansion not lifting a finger in times of need."
">shouldn't you love thy neighbor? Where is the love when thy neighbor needs serious help? 

How many people have you invited into your home to live after a natural disaster?"
"Houstonians weren't asking him to allow refugees into his home.  We were asking him to open the doors to what is, allegedly, a house of God."
You didn't answer the question.  How many have you allowed into your house?

Literally the entire underlying theme of the Bible is that WEALTH AND POWER CAUSE CORRUPTION. The poor, the meek, the humble, those who sacrifice their wealth and material possessions are the most saintly kinds of people, while those who hoard their wealth are probably all going to hell.

"Churches should be taxed.


All of them.


You spend most of your money feeding the needy?


Seems like you don't owe taxes.


You buy jets and limos, or just hoard the money?



Pay up."
Yup. They can itemize their charitable spending like anyone else. 
"This is literally how the UK does it.  Churches are registered as Charities and like every other charity, only their charitable works are tax free, and must have their books independently audited."
Great point
"And this is the only fair way to solve the problem. If you _selectively_ tax churches, it becomes a vehicle for the State to tax any church they don't like.

If you say ""the only organizations that are tax-exempt are defined in 501(c)(3) and 509(a)"", that's fair and doesn't place a burden on people exercising their religion. Property taxes are a little more complex (what's the fair way to assess taxable value of a place of worship, that doesn't privilege some kinds of faith over others?), but income taxes should be dead simple to do fairly."
"No, Churches shouldn't be taxed. And it goes against the First Amendment to do so."
"I think you missed the part of how they used the funds.


Also, not taxing them would be a detrimental to all those who are atheists.


I'm not an American, but that constitution of yours needs a bit of modernization, the 1st amendment was ratified in 1791, IIRC.


It's great to think of it as an infallible and all knowing, all permanent thing, but things change.



And how does taxation stops people from being able to exercise their religion?


Buying a jet for the pastor isn't a ""protected speech"", it's absolutely taking the piss out of the tax-free status.


Feeding the poor should be a genuine business expenditure and as such, reduce the taxable income."
"The Catholic Church uses the funds to pay 25% of the world's healthcare. If you want to actually help people, then not taxing them so they can spend more on helping people is the moral thing to do. But you don't actually want to help anyone, you just hate religion. 

And no, we don't need to ""update"" anything just so people can be arrested for memes you dislike. Nothing about the Bill of Rights needs to be changed; ""all men are created equal"" and other phrases are final phrases, you can't ""progress"" past them or ""update"" them."
"All men are created equal is from the Declaration of Independence, not Constitution. Also, that got an update in the 14th & 15th amendments. 

Catholic Church is a bad example just saying. They do good but also, cause a lot of harm with their healthcare, especially in Africa, because they refuse to do anything regarding birth control and some natal care which really is a disservice in those areas. Also note stuff like the vast wealth they have and on top of that how they have paying out tons of money in lawsuits recently because they refuse to hold their priests accountable. LA Diocese just paid almost a billion out. But they do some good but there is a lot of room for taxes in there that they can certainly afford. Same goes for the Mormons."
"1. Yeah, and? The principles are the same.
2. Ah alright so they can just not provide any healthcare at all, that's much better. 
3. I can tell you that the Church is always bleeding try from finances. They do not have a treasure hoard just because you think so.
4. That was from decades-old scandals.
5. No, charitable organizations should not be taxed. Notice how you're only doing it for Churches because of how discriminatory you are towards religion.

You literally only care about taxing churches because you want to feel like you have control over religion and that the state is ""superior"" to it."
"Found out recently that my cousin who i grew up with fell in the deep end with Joel Osteen. I thought he was smart, but oh well."
"It's insane. We are all a bunch of heathen atheists at home, and one night me and my adult kids were just talking in the living room late at night with the TV on and his ""ministry"" show came up. We decided to watch what it was all about.

It was 30 minutes of nothing. No teaching, no moral guidelines, nothing. He rambled on about some metaphor that I simply forgot, and repeated himself over and over for a long ass time. Of course, I do recall him sneaking in some items regarding giving. :|

He's not even engaging--he has this fake ass smile and fake sweet tone that's just fucking boring.

I don't know how people fall for his shit."
Watch Fulton Sheen.
Why?
"He was the original televangelist before it became a dirty word full of scammers like Copeland. He was an actual Catholic Bishop, and he's very good at explaining Christianity. I just don't want you to get a bad taste in your mouth when it comes to Christianity."
"I have a lot of Christian friends who are amazing people, and also know of a few churches that do great community work. I'm an atheist but also think that people should believe what they want as long as it makes them happy, be better people, and don't infringe on others' rights.

But in general, the larger the church, the sketchier it gets. Also, I know that prosperity gospel is its own virulent strain of Christianity."
"
Joel takes 101 level self help concepts and illustrates them with Bible stories. It’s banal but effective."
"I came up with an idea about Christian churches - basically that every church that doesn't double as a homeless shelter and food pantry gets taxed.  A lot of them do a lot of good outreach, but we need more.  They're the group that talks the most about doing it.  In the town I work in, we have 28 churches and one 60 bed homeless shelter that's constantly full of clients and understaffed.  Seems like there are a lot of buildings that sit empty most of the week and have a ton of people who are theoretically yearning to volunteer.  Do it or pay taxes to fund a government run program to do what you say you love doing."
"1. The Catholic Church currently pays for 25% of all healthcare in the world. They're doing enough.

2. The reason many churches don't allow homeless people in is because many homeless people end up destroying the building. I've heard of it happening right here."
Somehow homeless shelters manage to do it without having their buildings destroyed.  Not to say it doesn't happen or can't happen.  But it is telling if the first reason given for not offering shelter to the homeless is the assumption that they'll destroy the shelter.
Homeless shelters expect to have that happen and have cleanup crews to deal with it. Churches have to have volunteers clean up when people shit on the altar.
"1 - most homeless shelters have volunteers, too.  These are not typically ""abundance of funding"" establishments with a hired housekeeping staff.

2- what's with assuming people are going to shit on the altar?  I am genuinely concerned about how you view the homeless."
"Both points are spot-on.  To the second one, to deny entry/shelter based on what the homeless hypothetically \*could\* do, as opposed to serving the immediate need - helping someone - isn't very Christian.  In fact, it's quite the opposite, as it wreaks of hypocrisy and favoritism."
"1. Custodians aren't volunteers.

2. Because I literally have heard stories of homeless people shitting on the altars."
"1 - sometimes they are.  Most homeless shelters rely on volunteers.

2 - I've heard stories about spiders saving pigs by spelling out words in their spiderwebs."
"""You're a liar"" is not an argument. Homeless people are not just people who lose a job and need to get back on their feet, they're often drug addicts and mentally ill people. 

People like that shit on the street all the time, I have no idea why you think it can't happen in a Church."
">""You're a liar"" is not an argument. 

I never made that argument.  This whole exchange isn't much of an argument.

>Homeless people are not just people who lose a job and need to get back on their feet,

Yes they are.

 >they're often drug addicts and mentally ill people.

Yeah, that's also true.  Did Jesus die less for them?  Maybe he didn't die for them at all, and would have said ""ew, get away! You'll probably shit on my altar.  That thing is ornate, just how I like 'em."" Right?

>People like that shit on the street all the time,

Where would you have them do it, their own private bathroom?

> I have no idea why you think it can't happen in a Church.

It definitely could happen in a church. According to you, you heard a story about a time it did. I don't know why that's your default assumption about homeless people.  If you were homeless, and you were invited in, would your first move be to shit on the altar and trash the place?  You already know it could happen, right?  So is that what you would do?  Is that why you're stu k on the assumption that anybody would?"
"Mate I've literally studied homelessness. They aren't just people who lost a job.

Giving homeless people a place to sleep for one night isn't actually helping them when they don't have control of their mind or bodies. And people who do and are homeless can be provided with shelter elsewhere by the Church. Nobody needs to actually live in the building to be helped, at all.
[
Here's an example of the type of stuff they often do.
](https://old.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/199wget/more_than_200_spokane_churches_were_asked_to_open/kiiyflj/) Not to mention that most Churches don't actually have shelter sections, at all."
"Mate, you're full of shit and we both know it.  YouTubing homeless horror stories is not ""studying"".

>Not to mention that most Churches don't actually have shelter sections, at all.

And that's my problem with the modern Church.  Lots of funds for coffee bars and social groups, begging for just a little extra at Christmas because they need (new decorations, batteries for the new LED candles, a new projector and screen, a Steinway piano and) money for so many families in need."
"Mate I've literally looked into the economics of homelessness for Economics in College. I know what it's about. 

There are no ""coffee bars"" in Churches. If you're so morally superior, how about you let a crackhead into your home?"
">There are no ""coffee bars"" in Churches.

So you know fuck-all about churches *and* the homeless, and decided this is the conversation you're going to chime in on?  I would love to hear about what you ""looked in on"" during your college economics course.  Did they teach anything about the economics of the Vatican? You were pretty quick to talk up the catholics earlier.

As far as me being ""morally superior"", nah.  I'm about two bad days away from shitting on an altar somewhere.  The thing is, Christians will spout off about their inherent moral superiority to the point that it's nauseating.  They worship a guy who they'd vote to deport, because he was a homeless immigrant."
"If you studied economics, or homelessness, you would know that 99% of the chronically homeless are not just missing a home. They have severe illnesses that cannot be fixed just by putting them in a house or shelter.

The Vatican is literally bleeding money every single day because they're paying for a quarter of ALL healthcare. In the world.

I've literally linked multiple things proving that Churches housing the homeless is not feasible. At all. And you keep asking ""but why not?"", because you don't actually care about housing the homeless, you just hate religion.

So why aren't you housing any homeless people in your house, btw? Have you even been inside a church in the last 10 years?"
"I don't hate religion.  I'm actually a big fan of Jesus the Homeless Immigrant.

I'm not housing any homeless people right now because my house is full.  I'm also not taking donations on false premises about helping the homeless and using it to expand my McJesus franchise.  I am also not tax exempt, and am glad that part of what is taken from my paycheck goes to help addicts and the mentally ill.  I wish that part was bigger.  So I do my part by working in public health.  You are not going to tell me shit about homeless people based on your intro to college economics gloss-over when I work with them every day.  Go tell the pope to sell some paintings and gold if money's tight."
"Where are the homeless people in your house? And no, Jesus was not an immigrant, and he certainly wasn't an illegal immigrant, either. You just associate ""religion"" with modern politics because you're insane."
"Oh boy.  Tell me more about Jesus now, too.  Christmas is coming up soon, bud.  This year you should actually listen to the story."
I did. He was literally born in Judea and His family moved for the census. LMAO.
"For the CENSUS!? Don't talk to me about Jesus anymore, okay?  In fact, don't talk to anyone about Jesus or homelessness.  And probably economics."
Luke 2:1–2 dude. LMAO.
"Matthew 2 dude.  Or maybe that's one that you only ""looked into"", because it doesn't fit the narrative you want.  That would track."
"Leaving to Egypt doesn't make you an illegal immigrant, and Egypt was a Roman province. LMAO.

Admit it, you just look at random verses because you've never actually studied the Bible."
"Oh, so now he has to be an ""illegal"" immigrant?  You're just going to change it up and keep Ell-Emming your A off?"

When you start looking into how to make tax rules that force these ""entertainers"" masquerading as preachers to pay their share, but don't open the door for the government to tax religions they just don't like (and all the implications that has for religious freedom), it gets devilishly complicated. Like how do you set rules that tax Osteen but can't easily be repurposed to tax the local Unitarians out of existence?

And the grifters know it, and take advantage of it. The best scams are the ones that are close enough to legitimate that it's hard to regulate the scam without hurting legitimate business. And religious scams are the best because ""harming legitimate business"" can mean messing with a fundamental freedom."
"I went to church quite a bit in my late teens/early 20s. Knew Joel Osteen was a famous preacher but never actually listened to any of his preaching and didn’t know what to expect.

I was probably around 22 and I worked at a job where my boss was Christian and same nationality as me. She had tickets to see Joel Osteen at some stadium and invited me to go - I accepted and was very excited.

I didn’t realize this guy was a prosperity gospel preacher. I hated being there. He was doing his whole spiel: “This is YOUR year! You will get everything you’ve ever wanted! You just have to BELIEVE!!! It will all come to you! The Father takes care of his children!”. People were crying, hands raised, shouting/chanting “Amen! Hallelujah!” - I was incredibly disturbed. This wasn’t a nice sermon I attended, it was a weird cultish pep rally. I couldn’t believe how many people bought his bs. Couldn’t stand Joel Osteen ever since. He’s a scam."
Joel Osteen is a gay grifter.
"ALL CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS SHOULD PAY TAXES! That said, ALL CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS SHOULD PAY TAXES!


I say religious groups, because some do group meets at various places taking donations ect... during those meetings. 

One partner in a company I co owned would pay a 20% tithe to his church. This church had no actual building. They got to meet for FREE in a school gym every week. And I know for a fact that he donated well over 50k/year based on what he got from our company. PLUS he owned a lasertag/video game arcade and donated heavily for that too. AND he gave his church members discounts on lockins and playing blocks. It actually cost him this business because another member owned a skating rink with an arcade. ANd they made a huge deal about how lasertag and many of the arcade games were ""violent"" and the church turned away from him over it. After he had been giving them hundreds of thousands over the years. But could he still keep donating. He had to sell the arcade. And yet he kept donating to the church. 

They still meet in the school gym for free every week. And they make a shit ton of money every year. They have about 500 members that are regulars, and many own small businesses like my former business partner. That donate heavily. And they shove conservative politics down your throat at every service. I went to be polite a few times. And every time they tried to get me to tithe and donate. I was like, nope... I have better things to do with my money. 

ALL religions are a cult. Just because yours may be popular doesnt mean it isnt a cult. They all sell ""heaven"" for a price. And ALL religions prey upon the naive. 

FUCK, tax them at what your average ACTUAL small business has to pay in taxes. Around 25 to 30%"

"Kenneth Copeland, Trump's spiritual advisor, is a crook?"
Kenneth Copeland creeps me the hell out. Those eyes are soulless
aka prosperity gospel...or anyone who uses God to guilt trip or threaten people or scam people
God is so powerful but has to stoop down to earthly standards and beg for money. Sounds legit

"I don’t think I’ve EVER had any religious group actually knock on my door.  During COVID, the Jehovahs Witnesses sent me a letter.  I mean…I applaud their dedication."
"Was he one of those guys that would sell ""blessed"" items and prayers? ""Behold this blessed spring water, it can be yours for $49.99. Here are testimonials of miracles, both physical and intangible.""


Even when I was a christian, it was an obvious scam. I would actually read the Bible verses quoted to legitimize their claims. As you'd expect, they were cherry picked translations and taken out context."
That was Peter Popov with the miracle water.
"If Jesus can feed a crowd with a few fish and a few loaves of bread, I’m certain they can run a church with just a few dollars."
I seriously think Kenneth Copeland is a James Bond villain.
"That’s too kind, that man is 100% demon possessed"
I call them For Profit Prophets!
"Does Peter Popoff count or is he more of a ""faith"" healer?"
"My parents live in Florida and their ""local' news is a Fox affiliate. They always leave the TV on in the living room (Even at night for some reason).

I was staying with them for a bit and I have sleeping issues (I can't sleep for more than 3-4 hours at a time and have a hard time going to sleep).

I would be up in the middle of the night and seeing those disgusting ""plant your seed"" infomercials blew my mind. I've been an atheist basically since I was old enough to understand the world.

Using religion to rip off vulnerable people is just heinous. I don't know how those people sleep at night. They must be sociopaths."
"I grew up with holes in my clothes and hardly any food because these “preachers” kept telling my parents to send them a tenth of their income and prayers so they would become rich because god loves them. That tenth of their income, us kiddos desperately needed."
"Does this even count as a valid scam? Tithe to \*me\*, and \*god\* will settle accounts on my behalf... It's just openly bullshit."
Religious pimping
"Last night I happened across a TV preacher.  It was vitally important that you send him a seed to be planted in the soil of his church.  That seed being $1000.  He implored his viewers to find a way, find a credit card, and give him that $1000 seed, that their faith in God will ensure they can donate $1000.

And for those that truly believe, that donate $1000 in a credit card, God will reward them by erasing their credit card debt, but only if they call now, credit card in hand, and donate $1000.

I wonder how many donations he got from that little spiel, and how many people out themselves hopelessly in debt over it."
"Matthew 20: Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

22 “The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy,[c] your whole body will be full of light. 23 But if your eyes are unhealthy,[d] your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!

24 “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.

So yeah I’m sure these preachers read the bible regularly, maybe they’re just missing a page…"
"i said it before and i'll say it again, those ""preachers"" and televangelists are closer to satan than any self proclaimed satanist."
"Televangelism wasn't always this way, at its core it was just an idea to use new technology such as radio to preach. Fulton Sheen was called the first televangelist, and he was actually legit."
"On the other hand, The Righteous Gemstones is a great series. Hilarious and on the mark"
Religion is one helluva drug.

These people are the actual demons that they preach about.
My Jesus-loving grandpa who lived off of Social Security and a tiny pension regularly sent money to the TV preacher. He thought he was saving souls from the Devil.
Probably the biggest scam here.  WE FOOL YOU ✝️
TV preachers in general.
Ugh - so much this. It's permeated so much of Christianity. I was pretty shocked to learn how many co-workers and family members fall for this crap. It's very difficult to combat as they regard it as part of their faith.
My dad grew up just down the road from the PTL headquarters.
THIS. 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Religion
"Or just preachers. Organized religion in general, really."
not really. Plenty of churches that do good by people
"Surprised that I see a positive comment about religion here


But yeah, a lot of churches are affiliated with various charities. My church often has ex-drug addicts giving testimonies about how their faith helped them overcome their drug addiction and it's a wonderful sight to see"
"My wife's grandfather was a Nazarene minister.  During the Battle of the Bulge, he said ""Lord, if you just let me live through this, I'll give the rest of my life to you"".  He did exactly that and he was anything in the world but a prosperous man.  He darned his socks and sold wigs on the side to make ends meet.  He would sometimes leave a church to go to a smaller church to minister.  For most preachers, it works in the opposite.  The man truly lived by the word and I have nothing but respect for him."
definitely
"Ex-addicts giving testimony about their brainwashing is a sad event. Perhaps you should do research about the value of not introducing religion into addiction recovery. It is the better way.

Now you have substance dependent people giving thanks to imaginary beings when the actual real person that caused their recovery - themselves - is left feeling dependent on something imaginary. Backsliding is just an impulse away when you exchange dependency for dependency.

  
Edit: added a w."
"All churches lie to people in an effort to brainwash them into believing a creature for which there is zero evidence exists. Then the churches twist that brainwashing into demeaning others - nonbelievers or not - as sinners whether these ""sinners"" cause any harm to society or not. Then they seek to adjust society to their religion by voting to institute the beliefs of that religion on others.

Religion is evil."
You are insane.
I don’t know if you quite understand just how screwed society would be if we just did away with churches.
"I grew up in Ireland in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1980 it was a near-theocratic shithole, and by 2000 it was a modern secular state. Religious observance and church attendance plummeted during that time - from 80% in 1990 to 28% in 2020 (people who attend church monthly or more). That has coincided with enormous improvement in almost every area of life - from personal freedom to mental health to just general human decency. It's difficult to overstate how much society went from screwed to unscrewed as the Church declined in influence.

Now, I know correlation is not causation - but in this instance it's really difficult not to draw a direct causal line given that almost every improvement in human dignity during that time was vociferously opposed by the Church. And that's without getting into the weeds with the child abuse, slavery, septic tanks full of dead children, and all the other specific horrors the Church is responsible for. I'm just talking about general societal goodness, respect, and happiness."
"Just because things appear to be better, doesn’t mean they are. Ireland has one of the worst mental health rates in the EU, and was progressively getting worse even before COVID. 

https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/20f96f89-7286-4e4f-8a2c-bea12cf97576_en?filename=2023_chp_ie_english.pdf

Page 23 onward discusses the mental health issues in Ireland."
"Thanks for the link. It's interesting that we have lower levels of depression and suicide than the EU average - anxiety disorders account for the majority of the difference between Ireland and the rest of the EU. And the suicide rate is falling (I wish the data provided went back further than 2005 - the 1990s are when the Church faced its steepest decline, so that's the main decade of interest).

I will say in my case that I've had an anxiety disorder my entire life, but it was only diagnosed in adulthood. And much of mine can be attributed to PTSD from abuse suffered in the 1980s. I'd be surprised if my story was a rare one among people my age and older.

I'm sure this is a story among other countries as well, so I'm not sure how unique this is to Ireland, but there has been a massive increase in recent decades of awareness of mental health issues and their importance.

Also - looking at the ""Key Findings"" section - life expectancy is up, suicide is down (and below EU average), alcohol consumption is slightly down.

It's also worth noting the financial disaster that was 2008, and the global disaster that was 2020. Ireland is far from the only country to be hit hard by both of those years, and the data reflect that. That's all after the Church lost its grip on society though - as I said earlier, that mostly happened in the 1990s and early 2000s. [This table here](https://wid.world/www-site/uploads/2021/01/WorldInequalityLab_WP2021_01_EuropePolCleavages_Appendix.pdf#page=356) illustrates that nicely - even if it's only in decade-long data points, church attendance falls and ""no religion"" spikes during that time.

TLDR: The data show that Ireland has generally poor mental health, but it's not uniformly increasing and these data don't address the years we're talking about anyway."
"It's correlation. Religious people have statistically better lives according to studies, I see no reason why it would be the reverse in Ireland. 

Not to mention that I believe Church attendance is around 35% there today."
"There's a difference between individual people being religious and how it affects them personally, and the broader influence of religion on society. In my lifetime in Ireland, homosexuality was decriminalized (1989, opposed by the Church), contraception was made available without prescription (1990, opposed by the Church), divorce was legalized (1995, opposed by the Church), institutional indentured servitude was ended (1996, when the Church closed their last Magdalene Laundry), and more recently gay marriage (2015, opposed by the Church), abortion (2018, opposed by the Church), and blasphemy (2018, amusingly not opposed by the Church) were legalized via referendum. Plus there's the influence of the Church on schooling - their opposition to science-based sex ed, their spreading of lies about contraception, their late abandonment of corporal punishment, their general dedication to keeping people stupid and miserable - sure, maybe individual believers are happier. But their Churches make life worse for everyone. Religious people are very likely happiest if they're a minority, because theocratic societies are absolutely *not* where people thrive."
"Yeah none of that actually is real, and this ""religion is evil"" BS is stupid. People voted on policies that they agreed with based on their religion, so the society was fine with that. They weren't harmed by something they literally agreed to at all.

Voting based on your belief is not a theocracy either. None of your ""religion is good as long as it's a minority"" has any statistical proof at all.

This idea that most good things were opposed by the Church is also completely non-factual."
"Which part of that is not real? You don't think those laws were changed, or you don't think the Church opposed those changes? You don't think the Church kept slaves in Ireland until 1996? It's fairly widely documented. 

You do have a point about the complicity of wider society in the Church's worst misdeeds - it's made of people, after all, and those people didn't materialize out of thin air. The Irish State has paid compensation to some of the victims of the Magdalene Laundries (which the Church still refuses to do). People are not blameless when they do the shitty things the Church tells them to do. But whenever people start bettering themselves and making moral progress, the Church stands athwart that. I'd even argue that the Church has opposed almost every increase in human dignity over the last millennium or thereabouts. It certainly opposed the abolition of slavery until after the last major Catholic country had abolished it themselves (Brazil in 1888, followed by the Church in 1890).

But if we can't agree about what's real, there's unlikely to be a fruitful discussion. I assume if you're religious we disagree about lots of ways the universe works - but the history I outlined above isn't an article of faith, it's legal history that happened in the last 40 years.

In any case - I've seen with my own eyes how much better Irish society is now that the Church has lost its power. Individual people can believe what they like and if it makes them happier that's lovely. But giving a church any voice in policymaking is almost always the worst way to do it."
"1. You are stripping out context for everything you say. Letting mentally ill people/criminals work, or letting people admit themselves to these laundry things is not ""slavery"" any more than rehabilitation is slavery.

2. You are mentally ill.

3. Ireland is a country founded on terrorism and car-bombing children. It is not a happy place to live, and that's because your country is terrible. Don't blame Christians for any of that shit.

""I think life has gotten better"" is not proof it has gotten better. And you cannot just say ""you can't vote based on your core religious values"" just because you disagree with those values. That's not democratic at all."
"Whoo boy! I was all ready with citations to refute your first point (it was forced labour and they were not free to leave), but your third bullet point is *impressively* stupid. It betrays not only total ignorance of the topic at hand, but also pride in that ignorance. Congratulations?"
"I've literally read this, and forced labor isn't the same as slavery. Penal labor is penal or a reason."
(Available in the US only)
"I agree, id take it a step further and say organized religion, no one knows more than another about God"
"I was thinking about this the other idea.  Is it really a scam?  It seems very transactional to me.  People pay money, have faith and belief in this whole prosperity thing, and the person on the stage gets rich.  Scientology is an absolute scam, but those Prosperity Preachers...I mean you know what you're getting with them.  

I'd ban them both if freedom of religion didn't need to be an absolute freedom, and like the second most essential freedom for our democracy."
The Nigerian prince emails
"These are intentionally ridiculous / over-the-top / filled with errors. They don’t want to go back and forth with the 99% of people who can sniff out relatively obvious bullshit. They want that rare, vulnerable 1% who will take the bait and believe it. Phishing is a science."
There's a sucker in every crowd
"For years I've been trying to tell my dad this shit. And he still falls for it. That's why I told him at this point if he ever wants me to buy him something online it must be Amazon only. 

He recently sent me a link to buy a super cheap machine that was only 10% the price of what it was on Amazon. 

Shame he didn't read the link saying cossco.com and they required payment through PayPal only"
Can you provide a source for that? I see this posted all the time but I’ve never  seen anything other than “some guy thinks it’s what they do”
These people are smart enough to know how to phish people out of their entire bank accounts. I think they could spell the word “this” right.
"> Can you provide a source for that?

Subtle way of asking for a picture of their asshole."
The Confidence game is a great book written about the scam. They highlight the spelling errors as a feature to eliminate people that are “too smart.”
"Sounds interesting, did the author source anything from the scammers themselves?"
"So I Googled it and it appears they do: 

""Yes, scammers intentionally include errors in their emails, including Nigerian scam emails, for several reasons: 

 gullible targets

Scammers want to avoid people who notice mistakes and are less likely to be duped. They send intentionally flawed emails to isolate the most gullible targets. 

Get past spam filters

Scammers may misspell some relevant words to increase their chances of getting past spam filters. 

Make emails seem more authentic

Misspellings and grammatical errors can make emails seem more authentic and believable, especially when impersonating an individual. 

Build rapport

Minor errors can make emails seem more relatable and help scammers build rapport with their targets.""

So there you have it.

Edit: spelling"

"I'm pretty sure I did but here it is again.... 

While we may not have directly asked a Nigerian scammer about their motivations, the understanding of why scammers use misspellings in their emails is derived from several sources:

1. Patterns in Scamming Techniques

Research and Analysis: Experts in cybersecurity and fraud prevention have studied various scamming techniques, including those used in advance-fee fraud (often associated with Nigerian scams). Their analyses reveal common strategies employed by scammers.

Behavioral Insights: Behavioral economics provides insights into how individuals respond to certain cues, such as misspellings or grammatical errors. This helps explain why scammers might employ such tactics.

2. Scam Email Characteristics

Common Features: Many scam emails share similar characteristics, including poor grammar and spelling. This has been documented in various studies and reports on online fraud.

Targeting Vulnerable Audiences: Scammers often aim to reach individuals who may be less discerning or more likely to overlook red flags, which can include misspellings.

3. Expert Testimonies

Insights from Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Experts: Professionals in these fields have provided insights into the motivations behind scamming tactics based on their investigations and experiences with scams.

4. Victim Reports

Testimonies from Victims: Many victims of scams have reported that they initially overlooked the errors in the emails, indicating that these misspellings can indeed serve as a filter for less discerning individuals.

Conclusion

While we may not have direct statements from scammers themselves, the collective evidence from research, expert analysis, and victim experiences supports the understanding that intentional misspellings are a tactic used to filter potential victims effectively."

Correct. I've provided solid reasons why we think we know why they use misspelled works and poor grammar.  But he apparently wants to hear it from a Nigerian scammer. Good luck with that.

"I use Perplexity which uses about a dozen LLMs, only one of which is GTP-4.  And it does indeed provide references. That's how I chose the business insider article (one of many references provided) which I thought would satisfy the documentation requirement.  Apparently OP (and others) dismiss those who have spent their careers in cyber security or the behavioral sciences.

I have no experience in cyber security or behavioral sciences but I figure the original spelling and grammar errors were just as you suggest: language barrier. But as time has gone by they're just sticking with what works.  I figure they make enough money that they could put an English speaker on the payroll if they felt it would improve their odds.  But they know who, and who they do not, want to target.

If you haven't tried Perplexity I highly recommend it. Seems to be a cut above."

">lol you think the issue is which version of AI you use? 

I do think some are better than others. There's a lot of competition and investment dollars trying to come up with the best one. But that's not why I mentioned it. I mentioned it because you suggested I was using chat GTP. I just thought I should clarify.

>Again, many scammers have come forward to talk about their scams. Why do you think there is not one single scammer saying spelling mistakes are on purpose?

Have you heard of any saying they aren't on purpose?"

"I've watched and listened to various tech podcasts myself. One of my favorites is the white-hat hackers who intentionally respond to the scam emails. It's hilarious when they actually log into the scammers computer and wipe the whole hard drive. Sweet.

But I had already formed an opinion and use Google and various search engines (including AI) to see if I can convince myself I'm missing something or not thinking properly.

I think the jury is still out. 

But I do wonder, if the scammers thought it would be better to clean up their spelling and grammar, why wouldn't they just run them through spell check?"
[deleted]
"I'm not claiming it. I'm reporting what my research suggests is the general consensus of those who study such things or work in the industry.  But as a layman, I do tend to believe it.

Goodnight."
"Source: Google it yourself lazy bones

Also it does make sense. Someone competent reading something full of typos is more likely to ignore it compared to someone who still believes it's legit"
"I’ve googled it several times in the past and just now , what I’m saying is there’s no source like some reporter interviewing a scammer and them confirming that’s what they do. Or some government agency saying that’s what they do Just all speculation."

"Dude the second paragraph is literally all that I was asking, did someone actually ask the god damn scammers or did everyone just assume the grammar was intentional. 

You seem stuck on proving that the bad grammar is intentional and  that’s not at all the point. I was looking for a first hand account. That’s it. Im more than aware that there’s not a huge pool of scammers to interview but that’s what I’m asking for"
"I knew of this person who was promised tens of millions of dollars in new business deals and was being strung along for literal *years*.

By the time I unravelled what this person was trying to tell me, I was able to figure out the scammers were operating through at least two third countries to muddy the waters, but were ultimately (probably?) based in South Africa and any recourse was very unlikely.

I had to break the news that no, the bank draft they were promised wasn't legit. Meantime this person had sent the scammers somewhere north of a hundred thousand bucks."
My father in law almost fell for one of these. Not the Nigerian prince but a take on it.
"A lot of them aren't even from Nigeria, they just say they are because that's what's so associated with the scam."
"I've always wondered how someone so gullible that they fall for these scams ever actually gets their hands on the tens of thousands they get scamed of.

I get the oldies with their super and downsizing profits, but others are much harder to work out."
"Yeah people laugh at the mistakes but probably don't realize they're intentional. If you have critical reading skills, you're not the target audience. Always a bit conflicted feeling bad for the people who fall for this obvious stuff but a lot of them are sadly older people who are basically IT illiterate. Banks should offer more protection for suspicious transactions."
I'm surprised they have not moved to an Arabian prince or SouthAfrican mogul since the Nigerians are already well known
It being so well known helps them by weeding out sensible people and ensuring the only people who respond are ignorant suckers.
I remember seeing one about american soldiers in Irak needing help moving Saddam's money (or gold or whatever) worth about 5 millions during the Irak war.
"They must have seen Three Kings, starring Jeorge Klooney and Mack Wailburg."
"To be fair, we do have a South African mogul who is running cons quite successfully."
"Before the results of the US presidential elections one of the most popular google searches was ""Did Biden drop out?"". You give people too much credit."
Arabian Prince was never the same after he left N. W. A.
"What really gets me about those is that Nigeria isn't even a monarchy and hasn't been one for centuries (unless you count being a British colony, but they still didn't have any royalty of their own)."
"while it's not really the point, and Nigeria itself never had a monarchy, because Nigeria is a British creation, it is a bit more complex because there are plenty of entities within Nigeria which do have their own royalty. There are [Eze] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eze) amongst the Igbo, and for example there is still an [Oba of Benin] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewuare_II) and an [Emir of Kano] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanusi_Lamido_Sanusi) amongst much else around the country, so there are probably a lot of Nigerian princes even if they are not Princes of Nigeria!"

"I once worked with a woman whose mother got wrapped up in a Nigerian prince email scam. Smart as a whip as she was, she eventually figured out it was a scam, continued the relationship because she “understood why he would be trying to scam people and he apologized”.

She went to Nigeria and married him. I was sure she would have been kidnapped and held for ransom as soon as she stepped foot off the plane, but I saw the pictures first hand from her daughter, of her mid 60’s, human embodiment of unbaked pillsbury dough looking mother, in full traditional Nigerian garb, marrying a young 20 something Nigerian man. Saw pictures of her with his family, his/his families home and everything. 

She returned to the U.S. completely unharmed, on cloud nine, head over heels in love. She unfortunately died shortly after, before she was able to bring her husband over here. 

So for her, in a way, it worked out. She blew what little money she had to her name on a scam but spent the last year of her life probably the happiest she’d ever been."
That's kinda beautiful. Few of a kind story if true.
"This was a thing even before email.

I got a Nigerian prince letter in my PO Box back in the early 90s, same scam but done over letter/fax.  I didn't fall for it though."
Beat me to it
There's probably a legit price over there sad no one will respond to him lol
There is always that one comedian who just has some fun with them (annoys them) for material for his new show.

"I actually saw a letter to an advice columnist, stating that though he lived in England, his ancestors were minor Nigerian nobility.  His father had died and left the family fortune to him--a fortune that was, in fact, in overseas banks, frozen due to sanctions.  He said that he was decently well off already, so he didn't need the money, and he also agreed with the sanctions, but he wasn't sure how (or even whether) to go about telling people without sounding like a scammer."
Rock rock?
"Any time I am buying a gift card in a store, I have to agree to something that it’s not for someone online. The cashier will ask me to agree to it on the screen. I tell them, “No, this isn’t for an online scam. I’m just sending it to my cousin who is prince in Nigeria.”"
"I used to work in the Bureau of West African Affairs at the State Department as an intern when I was in college. This was over 20 years ago. Part of my job was to field calls from people with questions related to that part of the world. I would frequently get calls asking about the Nigerian emails and if they were legit. I would tell them it’s a scam and most would say that’s what I thought. However on a couple of occasions there were people who said I don’t know it seems like it may be real, I’m going to look into it further. Even when I would tell them I get these calls all the time. The level of stupidity in people is something else."
"Back before emails were really a thing we got a letter in the mail from a ""prince"". My parents saved it for the longest time because we couldn't believe it actually happened."
"I love reading the different takes on the Nigerian prince. From the classic prince, to my distant millionaire bridge engineering uncle dying in Congo, to ""I found a loophole in a Chinese bank's system, wanna lend your bank account to commit international bank fraud?""

My sister fell for it...twice. I really wish I were making that up.
I was looking for this
STILL??? It still works?!?
"My sister works at a bank customer service, damn I wish she could tell those stories freely..."
My FIL would get those emails all the time and he'd reply just to mess with them.
Does Nigeria even have a prince?
I have never received one and would be kind of excited if I did. Like finding a penny heads-up excited.
"Literally anything related to the slimy Kenneth Copeland Ministries. That guy is one of the biggest con artists, if not THE biggest, to ever exist in this country."
He's scary looking!
"For those who haven't seen him, imagine ""Demon wearing human suit"".  Then go look at his picture and be surprised you already knew what he looked like."
"That's so funny, I googled him for the first time and immediately thought ""nope, he looks like he's wearing someone else's face, I'm out"" and then closed the tab"
He looks like a partially digested George Hamilton.
"Remember the movie *The Mask*, when the bad guy puts on the Mask?  That's Copelands's face, just green."
"Holy Hell! Never heard of this guy, but I did go and Google him. He does look like he’s wearing a much larger man’s head ( a man who’s in the middle of having a really bad reaction to bees) and those hands!! 
According to Wikipedia, he’s worth $300 million. He must be a very successful scammer."
Thank you. This was everything I was hoping for.
The face holes of the suit are pretty worn now from all the demonic glares and scowls he gives reporters.
"Good lord, you are 100% spot on in your description."
"Cotton Hill, if Cotton Hill was evil, is another good comparison."
Indeed.
He looks like the villain in the movie Mask.  Did you see when reporter Lisa Guerrero from Inside Editions asked him about saying he wouldn't fly commercial with demons on a plane.  His mask came of then.
"He's a fucking evil person. And yeah, he definitely is scary looking. Especially with all that fucking makeup he's always wearing. Have you ever watched any compilation videos on YouTube where it's clips of him acting super fucking crazy?"
">videos on YouTube where it's clips of him acting super fucking crazy?

Is that not just every video he appears in? Dude is fucking deranged"
"[this one is amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LtF34MrsfI) where he gets cornered by a reporter and she asks him about why he needs a private jet (hint: its because demons can only fly commercial evidently)

homeboy is in the running for to be the literal antichrist. what a fucking goblin."
Ah I was hoping it was that vid. That one in particular shows how deeply disturbing and downright fucking scary of a creepy bastard this mf is.
[deleted]
"He wears it literally all the time, and yes, he is a crazy person. Where have you been? Lol"
He's a literal spawn of Satan.
Yes!!! The videos of him that have been posted are straight up satanic looking...
He reminds me of the devil in human form.
"I’m 51, I remember seeing him on TV when I was in elementary school (we only had 3 channels, options were limited).  He looks basically the same. If anyone in the world has possibly sold their soul to Satan, it’s him."
Pete Hegseth is a younger version of that creep.
I always thought he looked like an actual demon wearing human skin.
He literally looks like the Antichrist
Look up his age and it gets even scarier.
Thank you!!
"Looks very much like Matt Gaettz, who looks like a young Rudy Giuliani."
Terrifying even
I remember my mom sending him money in the 90s and she got some like handkerchief he “blessed” and she had me put it to my face and ‘feel its warmth’
"My mom donated to him as well, and once we found out we really called her out in it so she said she'd quit. After she died I found a ton of his stuff in a box she had been hiding. It really pissed me off that he was just syphoning money from her. I mean she was at fault for sending it in the first place, but just like most old people she was impressionable and totally duped."
You don’t think… nahhh. Lmfao
"On the plus side, they could rest reasonably comfortably knowing that the handkerchief and that sleazeball Copeland never even occupied the same time zone at any point."
Joel Olsteen would like a word.
Fuck that guy too. He's def no Kenneth Copeland though. The demon in makeup.
"Especially because he calls himself a ""pastor"" and uses the term ""ministries"" and performs a few fake miracle healings and the money rolls in from people wanting to ""sow a seed"" for a free prayer cloth or whatever. Easy to quote a few out of context scriptures and twist their meaning and sound like you know what you're talking about."
"Exactly. He's literally told his followers that he had the power to make their hair grow. And he loves to get involved in politics. He announced that any Christian who would vote for Hilary Clinton would be considered a murderer in God's eyes. Don't even get me started on him abusing tax loopholes, his ridiculously lavish lifestyle, his stance on vaccines and COVID. He's just a giant cancer to this country. To this world."
I collect old gospel albums and ended up with a few of his. He is amongst the creepiest. I honestly think he's the devil he warns people about.
He definitely has evil in his eyes. He exudes it. He knows damn well when he's up there preaching to his lemmings that everything coming out of his mouth is complete bullshit. He fucking knows for sure.
Isn’t he Trumps “spiritual advisor”?
Yup. Checks out
He is such a good [metal singer though](https://youtu.be/0JPRvxTjfOk?si=GlzEUvUTN-_8Jiot&t=42)
"I bet he hates that, and it makes me so happy."
Classic!
"my uncle looks EXACTLY like him and also happens to be a misogynist.. like said ""women don't belong on espn"", lol. ITS IN THE GENEEESSA"
I bet he's a real treat on holidays
He's got to maintain that heavenly bank account somehow.
Benny Hinn has entered the chat.
"He's right there with them, but Copeland still takes the cake"
"> That guy is one of the biggest con artists, if not THE biggest, to ever exist in this country.  

Kenneth Copeland didn't get elected president twice... I think there's a one-up."
"No but he's right there as his spiritual advisor, and he wasn't running for president. Not enough money in it for him, and he'd actually have to work instead of people just freely handing it over to him without having to pay taxes whatsoever."
"Friendships with military colonel’s stuck overseas, looking for companionship, which turns into needing money."
sounds very specific
"Romance scams, and adding in the ""It's a soldier"" part. And an officer! Officers make big buckaroos."
"Yes, generally you need to be specific when describing something"
All the women love Colonel Angus.
Yes. This is their formula. These scammers aren’t artists carefully crafting unique love stories.
"It's particularly insane when romance scammers pretend to be in the military, on military service. One second of logical thinking, which I realize is inherently missing in these exchanges, would tell you that no one in the military *on active service* is ""trapped"" overseas or ""unable to access their records/veteran's benefits/etc."" without paying huge sums of money. The military gets a lot of flak, and rightly, but they transport people (or pay for the expenses thereof) people in active duty. They feed them. They house them. And they sure as hell don't find themselves magically unable to access their own servicemembers' records while they're in another country. It's like...not how *any* of this works."
"That has never made any sense to me. A Colonel makes like 90 something thousand a year. If bro has spent THAT much money then some random person working a normal job isn’t gonna be able to help them much. 

If you have the time to spare, what’s fun to do is play them along. Get info out of them. 

How long have you been in?
What’s your job?
What’s your unit? 
Where are you stationed? 
Why are you there?

And then proceed to poke holes in their story."
"They don't spend much time on a potential victims that ask too many questions. But usually the story is that the funds on their account are locked because of some complicated sounding reason, and as a result they can't go on leave/return from deployment. If you know anything about the military, you know that story doesn't make any sense, but again, they don't spend time on people like that."
Bet they are going some random desperate chick or old lady is gonna get the message and not actually think it though. I hope people who orchestrate those scams get impassable kidney stones.
">A Colonel makes like 90 something thousand a year

A Colonel is making way more than 90k a year, shit I'm an E-6 and my PSMC (end of year breakdown of pay) shows I made 94k last year. I wouldn't be even remotely surprised to see a full bird pulling double that, easily."
"I forget the exact number, been a bit since I last checked. Base pay for a full bird is over 8k a month coming out to over 90k a year. I was going low to keep from over shooting it. 

But their reasoning just makes absolutely zero sense. Like why contact a random citizen you have never personally met? Isn’t that why the JAG corps exists? To handle legal issues? 

When I get those emails if I have free time, I’m willing to do the research as to what units are based where and calculate their time in grade to poke holes. It’s fun to make them scramble to explain themselves. I will do a ton of research on random shit just to piss someone off. Never underestimate my ability to be spiteful."
"O-6 pay starts at 8k a month for less than 2 years in service. It takes 15 years minimum to make Colonel, so that part of the pay chart is never used. 


Realistic starting O-6 base pay is 11-12k a month, plus another 25-35% on top of that for housing and subsistence."
"That's base pay man. Base pay is a *tiny* fraction of income in the military, *especially* for higher officers and those in special positions."
"Not a tiny fraction, base pay is 2/3rds to 3/4ths of the total pay for higher officers. 


And that's a higher portion than lower ranks. Base pay scales up faster by rank than BAH and BAS. Which makes sense, since being higher rank doesn't necessarily mean you need humongous house or tons of food."
"My MIL has fallen for THREE of these scams. She's dating someone from her work place now, but for the last three years she was hook line and sinker for these romance scammers. It was always the same story too- some kind of high ranking military dude who was locked out of his bank account OR trapped in a foreign country and needed her to marry him to get him back to the states. One of them in particular  got over 15,000 dollars out of her over the span of about 9 months to a year. Then she went and fell for it two more times. Some people you really just can't convince it's bullshit."
That’s terrible & sad!  I’m so happy she found someone close by to date.  Companionship is so important and it’s terrible that people take advantage.
"When I was an Army IG I got tons of these from people who had been scammed.  One was still sending money even after we told her it was a scam.  We explained that the person didnt eixst and even if they did they would never need private money for anything.  She responded ""You are just part of the coverup.""

SMH"
How tragic!
"""I'm a US colonel stuck over seas and I need-"" 

Me: ""Stolen valor is a federal crime, if you can contact me you can contact your government fuck buddies. Bye"""
"My aunt fell for this one... Twice. Not kidding. She had a podcast for Senior Citizens and she decided to do research on Online Romance Scams and got scammed herself in the process. Sent over $10k to help with ""the cause"", her kids found out and stopped it, and then she got scammed again the same way. Almost $50k sent over a year. Again, not kidding, in fact I wish I were. 

Life is hard. It's even harder when you're stupid."
r/oddlyspecific  :D
"""Grandma? I'm calling from the police/hospital. Can you send me money?"
"I've gotten a few of those calls. I just mess with them and say, ""Bobby, is that you?"" (I don't have a child or grandchild by that name).

They answer, ""Yes, it's me!""

Then I waste their time on the phone, acting like I'm concerned, etc."
"I'd go with 'Well Bobby, I told you what would happen if you got caught up with those drug running meatheads!  If you want me to bail you out, then you'll need to tell me where you stashed the money!  I ain't doing shit for you for free!'"
"Oh that's good! And then say stuff like, ""Do you need me to help you hide another body this time? Well, this time I expect to be paid! And upfront before we do it!"""

This is always fun. My grandfather would just play “confused old man” till the other person got frustrated and hung up.
"I scrolled too far to see this one as it hits too close to home. My grandmother sent them $8000 in a bank draft through Purolater to get me out of “jail”. 

She called me on my cell the next day after she sent it and asked if I was okay and if I’ll be going to court. After her explaining the details and me breaking the news to her she started crying on the phone. Hearing my grandmother cry like that hit me so hard. 

I fucking hate those scammers with every ounce of my being."
"There will be hackers on FB that will post something on your friend's page saying ""so tragic we will miss him""

If you ever see that and are really concerned contact your friend directly--never click on anything in those posts"
"Not surprised that older people fall for those scams though, a lot aren’t that tech savvy and sometimes there’s mental decline involved as well. And sometimes even if the old person understands something is wrong they can’t defend themselves as well as a younger person. People scamming seniors are another level of evil."
Unfortunately these are about to get way more refined due to AI
"Oh this one has started becoming very popular in my country. Funny story, they call my mom to tell her that her son was in the hospital, while both me and my brother were in the same room with her. Not funny story, my grandma almost took the bait in another case, but we managed to avert it."
"One tried that with my grandma. She had 2 grandsons and the voice on the other end of the call could've been either of theirs. She fell for her share of scams, unfortunately, and probably would've fallen for that one, too, had they not said yes when she went ""Josh?"" It immediately clicked that the number wasn't from the prison, where my cousin Josh was incarcerated at the time, and he obviously wasn't broke down while on vacation in another state."
"Your grandma’s very lucky, I already posted above to the original comment how my grandmother fell for one. 

The “grandma I’m in jail and need money” and me being the trouble maker growing up she instantly responded with my name without even asking which one of her grandchildren was calling. To which it just made it an easier set up for the scammers to get her - she swears the voice on the line sounded just like me - how much you can trust an old woman’s hearing I’m not to sure. Has me curious about deepfake voice possibilities but I don’t know. 

All I know is hearing my grandma cry over the phone over falling for one gave me a burning hatred for scammers."
"I actually fell for a more high tech/advanced one of these. The scammers hacked my friend's Snapchat and were sending me messages pretending to be him, drunk and in a tight spot (that wasn't well-explained, but I figured it was just because he's drunk), and I got locked out of my Venmo so can you send the money to my friend?

The scammers picked a really good mark. That friend is exactly the kind of person who would do that. It would not be the first time I'd Venmo'd him enough money for an Uber home. And then the scammers got bold and kept asking for more. I started thinking *he* was getting shaken down. I was telling him ""This sounds like you're getting scammed, tell me where you are, I'll send you an Uber."" The conversation devolved and I finally called his phone number directly so he'd quit drunk-panic-spiraling and just tell me where the fuck he was.... and his phone was off. That's when I realized *I* was getting scammed. 

Hard lesson learned: sending money to friends requires Facetime."
With advancements in deepfake tech they're going to get a lot better over the next few years. Where they'll scrape your data on social media and find your grandkid's social media and clone their voice and info.
Yup. It’s a huge problem. We like to think that we won’t fall for that but you never know.
"Honestly I'd wager that there will thanks to those advances in deepfakes/ai/digital trickery be a whole industry revolving around physical transmission. Like contracts will go back to being signed with ink, important papers will be physically couriered, that kind of thing."
"Exactly. Very scary technique. Would say: hang up the phone, call them back and when they answer and everything is fine, you know it was a scam."
I’m glad that my grandmother is as smart as she is at 96. She got a call a few years ago saying it was her “grandson” and I was in the custody of the Mexican police and I needed $5000 to get out. She asked if she could call them back and then she called both me and my only other male cousin. Both of us were not in Mexico at the time.
Good that your grandma was on top of things. My ex MIL is quite gullible and hard of hearing. She got a call from my son saying he was in  an accident. We live 450 miles away but he happened to be working in her area. She was suspicious so she got the information and then called the police!
"""Heyyy gurl it's me, your deskmate from 8th grade! I need money, can you help or are you broke?"""
"Once had my rich friend message my broke ass, saying she's made a lot of mistakes in life and is struggling to survive and needs financial support.

For context, we were 15 and she still lived with her parents.

Though it was written in a very convincing way for those who didn't know her closely. A classmate of ours got that message too from her hacked account, and he came to her in class to politely decline her request for money. She was extremely confused cause she didn't realise she was hacked.

We had some good laughs about it."
"My wife's grandfather got hit by one of these. Luckily he didn't send them any money but the scammers were particularly persistent. Lots of follow up calls with fake crying, saying they were my brother-in-law, etc.

Makes me so mad"
"given that they're replicating people's voices now, it's very understandable that people fall for that one

set a ""family password"" with your relatives"
"Not the policehospital! How many giftcards should I get, sweaty?"
My grandma nearly fell for this one until she looked at the number.
"Reminds me of a story my husband told me. His grandma got a call like this. Fortunately, she basically said if this is fake, go to hell, but if it is real, then you got yourself into this mess so you can get yourself out. Thankfully it was a scam"
"The amount of people who put their trust in apps like Snapchat believing them to be 100% secure and private and that everything they send on there, yes EVERYTHING,  isn't stored in some server somewhere with their verified details attached to it all.... because.... Snapchat saves everything you send on there and there are countless examples of that information being retrieved and leaked online. 

It's also incredibly easy to install work around which don't notify the person of images being screenshotted, so another reason to not blindly assume it's some super secure social media platform."
"Or any random app for that matter. I downloaded a crossword puzzle app and it asked for permission to access my microphone. I immediately deleted it. 

A lot of these ""free"" apps just want to datamine you."
"What's the old saying, ""if something is free, then *YOU* the product"". 

Similarly I question when the stock Google calculator tells me I need to update it. Like, why? Is there a new way to do math now?"
">A lot of these ""free"" apps just want to datamine you.

*Every* ""free"" app wants and does that. People don't spend months/years developing apps for no reason."
"There are a lot of apps that start out as hobbyist projects and get hijacked later on.

When I recently transitioned phones, an app that basically adds widgets to your home screen (purely cosmetic) got updated and suddenly needed full permissions for everything."
"Lot of free apps are monetized by running ads, or have a freemium model where they try to get you to subscribe"
"Not shady per se. It depends on an API they use. Sometimes they ask for permission to read contact information. Not to abuse it, but because they have a ""share"" UI that utilizes it. So it ""could"" be unrelated to shady practices."
The FBI literally has a backdoor into the app and has their own server of data for Snapchat.
"It's actually kind of clever when you think about it. People are more brazen on Snapchat because ""it's not permanent"" in their eyes. I wouldn't be surprised if Snapchat was actually some kind of government honeypot to catch criminals."
"The FBIs backdoor is called a subpoena.

They don't need to backdoor Snapchat, they just ask Snapchat for your messages and Snapchat gives the messages to the FBI."
That's only if the government is utilizing the legal process. NSA already has everything that's ever touched any part of the US telecom infrastructure.
"FBI, NSA, DEA, etc have systems actively monitoring cellular and online data, as well as backdoors into many online services, operating systems, and devices. They no longer have to go and request logs in court for many reasons."
I’m super grateful that Apple has recently started giving notifications about apps having access to your photos for x amount of days. I’ve started managing access to photos instead of just giving apps a free for all of my photos
Reading the Windows privacy policy really made me appreciate the Apple approach. They aren’t perfect but it’s still better I think.
Oh I agree! Like obviously if you like do something crazy illegal they aren’t going to protect your privacy but even their speech to text is all in-house so to speak so that’s why it’s not as good as google’s and Microsoft’s
"Add to this the ""fun"" surveys like...tell us the story of you and your partner and asks for anniversary date and major locations. Or info about you - how many pets do you have? What are their names? 


..these are all common security questions. Stop giving away your personal information on social media because it's fun.


Plus the ""show is your 10 year glow up!"" Or ""a picture of you as a kid vs today. It's all AI training. "
"I remember being baffled watching Now You See Me - a movie in which a group of hustlers steal millions from a rich git by asking him a few basic questions.

It had never occured to me that people would use the relevant, honest answers to security questions. After all, I know most of my family and friends' pets names, mothers' maiden names etc and presumably they know mine. It's like having your date of birth as the PIN for your front door, and actually writing ""What is your date of birth"" on the keypad. Why would anyone ever use that sort of freely accessible information for security?

Then I learnt the simple explanation: far too many people are idiots."
No they do clear out information periodically. That being specific messages and images. It costs a lot to store that much data especially when they aren’t profiting off of 99% of it.
"Not to mention the easiest of methods, having another camera to take pictures of the picture."
"I don't understand how Snapchat still has a reputation for having a ""feature"" that nukes messages, images, and videos off its database."
"They have essentially build a reputation on a lie, that everything you do on there is private between you and whoever you choose to share that content with. When in actual fact, SC explicitly mentions in their TOU that everything use share on their stored on their servers and linked to your account."
"You're right.

It's incredible that they still managed to exempt themselves from the ""everything on the internet is forever"" rule."
"fun fact you can straight up request all your data from them too. all your saved snapchat logs, pics, stories, comes in handy if someone is acting like chris d'elia and you wanna leak/report it, but people use it to save all your nudies to their desktop. DONT SEND NUDIES TO STRANGERS ON SC!"
I love the look on Chris D'Elia's face when he's on a podcast and someone's talking about how it's easy to copy messages from snapchat and how nothing is ever really deleted. He's just doing the mental maths in his head of exactly how cooked he is.
">work around which don't notify the person of images being screenshotted

This SHOULD be so obvious! It's on the damn screen, you can record it in any way you want, literally with a physical camera for example. Only screenshots taken through the system actually register."
People do the same with Reddit

"Or how about the ones that ""must give way this $400k RV"" because the lugnut covers are the wrong color and ""the factory won't take it back."" Just comment ""win"" and share this post!!


Other variations include, ""our previous winner was 15 and could not claim."" "
"Or those facebook pages pretending to be companies that are ""sadly going out of business after so many wonderful years"" with their ""high quality, handmade products"" and offering incredible discounts, but all their photos are either stolen or AI-generated, and the web domain was registered last week and is always some nonsense word like koogboemstar dot com."
"I know a guy  who buys newish wrecked V8 cars, and sells off the engine/trans/wheels, etc.  He has a website to purchase said items, plus a FB and instagram.  On his FB he CLEARLY says only deal with my website.

There's like 7-10 scam facebook pages that use his company name, profile picture and reupload the same images stolen from his page.  Multiple times he will get a phone call from a pissed off guy saying, ""WTF MAN, I sent you 11K now 5 weeks ago where is my engine?""  He looks up the name and they have no history of that name. Dude sent the money to one of the scam pages, mostly from Africa.   He has to tell the person the sad truth.  You're fucked!"
"Oh, I have a few friends that ALWAYS fell for these. It was always Ellen Degeneres or Disney Cruise lines or some company giving away a free car, lol. But there was always something slightly off that made it obvious, like Disney Cruise.s!"
And Ellen mysteriously can no longer spell her own last name.
I've not seen one of these. What is it?
"I blocked them, so I don't know if they're still around, but there used to be fake FB pages claiming to be celebrities, car companies or cruise lines telling people to comment something and they would get a chance to win a car, free cruise, etc and there would be SO many people commenting and saying they hope they win for their grandkids or whatever. But the pages always has some weird misspelling or odd punctuation that would be questionable."
"Pretend ""RV WORLD"" has 350K likes, and is a legit business.  Someone created ""RV WORLDS"" and their first posts is ""Sadly List Smith never claimed her price from the raffle last month, so we're gonna give it to one of our followers, like and share to be entered.""  With a couple days the page will have 10, 20, 40K likes, and a nonstop list of boomers reply ""I would love to win this, please pick me.""  I think when you comment, the page auto send you a message with a link to ""confirm"" your entry.  That's where they get your personal info like name and address, etc."
Omg this hurts my soul bc so many ppl fell for it back in the day and I'd have no choice but to look at them differently ☠️
"I see job posting like this all the time on public fb pages for me city. Basically, ""Vague company is looking for people to work from home for a pretty high hourly salary, no experience needed. No job details provided what so ever."" 

I can't believe people respond, comment, or think they are real. 

Also, I live in ATL, GA. The amount of ""Tyler Perry"" posts I see about free giveaways that are so obv fake but people buy it!!! He does do charity work and food giveaways (mostly around the holidays), but those are organized and announced by reputable organizations. Not posted about on FB with a selfi."
"How about those bot posts that copy old comments? Those are annoying.

"Door-to-Door anything (scouting fundraisers being the exception).  When we moved in we were getting several a day....had to put up a ""No Soliciting"" sign."
"My sign says ""We have enough Jesus and don't need a new roof, but if you're selling tamales come on in!"""
"Mine says ""No Soliciting, unless you brought alcohol, sell girl scout cookies, or are delivering a package. Seriously, don't make it weird"""
Can you add Boy Scout popcorn?  That is Boy Scout's biggest fundraiser.
"At like $50 per bag. Thats ridiculous. They should be able to sell like, tamales or brownies, or whatever."
You'll still get knocked on
"I have one. My logic is, if you're still knocking after you see the sign, I don't have to pretend to be nice anymore, because you chose to be an asshole and solicit anyway. It's refreshing."
Then let it be a battle of wits!
"I'm going to get downvoted for this, but door to door isn't always a scam. Sometimes it is, and that shit ruins it for the legit companies. I'm speaking from experience here, having done this type of work for legitimate companies with quality products, managed those sales teams/offices, and been a director of specialized marketing programs. 

It's a marketing strategy that has worked for decades and continues to do so, according to a recent Forbes article. Probably one of the cheapest ways for companies to get the word out about their product, as nearly all d2d workers are 1099 and paid commission only with no benefits like health insurance or retirement savings programs. Like it or not, and I totally get why a lot of people don't, the capitalist society in which we live means that companies are going to save money everywhere they can, and everyone being shitty to the person at their door who's just trying to pay bills or feed their family does not even consider this. (Granted, if that knocker is an ass, as unfortunately some are, then hey, do what you gotta do.)

Problem is, YMMV depending on the salesperson and/or the company. I'm all about more regulation in my current industry to provide more consumer protection, because bad actors fucking people over not only piques my sense of injustice, but has essentially made it way more difficult to do the job than it needs to be and directly impacted my income pretty significantly and recently. 

What a lot of people don't think about is that there are bad actors in every industry. Healthcare, hospitality, government, law, utilities, everything. If you buy a car and have a bad experience or end up with a lemon, do you never buy another car again? Most people do. 

The Internet can only help so much. And yeah, I completely understand that most people just want to seek out the things that they want when they want it and not have it presented to them unsolicited, which is totally fair. But how does one learn that the thing they want is out there, or even that they might actually want/need it, beyond basics like food and shelter? Marketing. For pretty much everything. In all kinds of ways. 

Idk. I know I sound a little crazy, but let's not major in the minors here. Capitalism means that a majority of people have to do whatever they can to make ends meet. I think we need to turn a more critical eye to the companies/systems and be kind to each other individually."

"Organic food in the U.S.

The regulations have been so watered down as to be meaningless…"
And worse the insane money you have to spend to prove it's organic.
"Yessssssss.  I work at a restaurant that's also a whole animal butcher shop, and people often ask if our meat is ""certified organic"".  I tell them, ""No, organic is just a word that's bought and sold.  What's more important is that our butchers know the farms we're buying animals from and have the experience to know what good, sustainably and ethically raised animals look like.  Also it's crazy expensive to get organic certified, and we don't buy from farms that are big enough to be able to afford that""."
">No, organic is just a word that's bought and sold.

I feel the same about the various fair trade, ethically sourced emblems you see on  products."
"Fair trade… yeah, there’s a price minimum paid, and an additional premium. Some labor treatment is supposed to be monitored. But visits are announced and they can get around much of this. Tony’s does a good job explaining the ins and outs of this stuff and how imperfect it is. But the alternatives in most cases is far worse."
"I'm sure there are so many ways to game the ""fair trade"" system, it would make your fucking head spin."
"The Gastropod podcast did an episode about the shrimp industry. They talked to a whistle blower who worked in the industry, in Indonesia if I recall correctly. They had an auditor from one of those ethical treatment of workers organisations come in and inspect the plant. They passed. The problem is the actual plant where they did most of the work preparing the shrimp was in another location nearby. Conditions were horrible, like no running water horrible. A food processing plant with no running water."
"One Thanksgiving my butcher was selling ""gluten free"" turkeys.

I asked him about it because, y'know, all meat is gluten free.

He said ""*I know that, and you know that, but the people that are only gluten free for the fad don't.  And it's not like I'm lying to them.*""

He didn't jack up the price, they were on average the same as everywhere else.

But people are really into the labels."
"I will say, as someone with celiac (not trendy just sick) that deli meats and other processed meats often contain gluten. And meat marinated or injected with flavor (smoke flavor, for example) do too. But a whole turkey is probably safe."
"Oh look, it's a farm big enough to afford certification and all of the expensive herbicides and pesticides and are OK with polluting their land with more of both of them!

Like, y'all ""organic"" eaters need to realize it takes **more** chemicals to grow organic food. I've seen farmers that refuse to go organic because they didn't want to poison their land and waterways more than if they continued using synthetic chemicals rather than switching to organic chemicals."
"Yeah I don't understand why people think organic produce is pesticide free. Do they think bugs and wildlife are like 'oh no this is organic,  we can't eat it' lol."
Where are you getting this information from
Happy to see this. It was my thesis topic and it’s definitely not what people think it is. Buy the “cheaper” version or grow your own because the USDA organic label means next to nothing.
"I second the other reply, I'd enjoy reading your thesis"
Is your thesis published? Would love to read
"That’s interesting, why is it that organic milk lasts for a few months and non-organic lasts for like two weeks then?"
"Check the label. Organic and most carton milk is ""ultra-pasteurized"" instead of just pasteurized like most regular/jug milk is. That basically means the milk is heated to a MUCH higher temp for a very short time to kill everything inside the milk. There is arguments for both methods as far as safety and taste goes"
What’s the best way to get organic but just hasn’t been labeled as such? Farmers markets?
"Organic pesticides are still pesticides. 

https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/anr-69"
But which ones are more toxic at the trace amounts still found on produce when people eat it?
Zero. None. That's why organic produce is an absolute sham.
"Zero what? Zero trace amounts? That's not true.The EPA sets limits on how much pesticide is tolerated on produce when it's sold. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide_residue

It's a very small amount, but it's non-zero. I'm sure they set that # based on all available data, but often we don't have good data on long term health risks, so there's only so much that can be taken into account.

There's also studies like [this](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/22/health/organic-food-cancer-study/index.html), which found eating organic produce correlates negatively with cancer risk. Of course correlation isn't causation. Eating organic produce can correlate with income or general attitude towards health, which can explain the decreased risk. But it could also be the lower toxicity of organic pesticides at the trace amounts allowed by the EPA. 

My point is long-term health risks of the trace amounts of pesticides found on produce are under studied. People shouldn't be so confident in proclaiming that synthetic pesticides don't pose any larger health risks than organic ones. It's possible, but if people want to spend a little more to decrease this possible risk that's a rational decision."
"Zero meaning, zero current pesticides are toxic when consumed in trace amounts. Not zero pesticides left. 

That study asks whether people consumed organic foods or not. It did not compare equal diets of conventional and organic foods. There is a lower cancer risk associated with a generally healthy diet and those who eat organic fruits and vegetables are eating fruits and vegetables. The others very well may just never be eating any fruit and vegetables. I even buy organic sometimes because the conventional version isn't available, and would fall into the ""organic"" group, but I fall into that group because I eat a generally healthy diet. They didn't control for this very obvious bias which is why the conclusion of the study says ""further research is necessary to determine the underlying cause in this association."" 

Here is a systematic review (highest level of evidentiary support on Melnyk's pyramid) of 35 papers (including the study you linked as citation 53) that is the ""further research"" your solitary study called for showing the exact bias I mentioned. 

""While findings from this systematic review showed significant positive outcomes from observational studies in several areas, including reduced incidence of metabolic syndrome, high BMI, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, infertility, birth defects, allergic sensitisation, otitis media and pre-eclampsia, the current evidence base does not allow a definitive statement on the long-term health benefits of organic dietary intake. Consumption of organic food is often tied to overall healthier dietary practices and lower levels of overweight and obesity, which are likely to be influential in the results of observational research.""

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019963/

For what it's worth the FDA has banned several synthetic pesticides that were toxic in trace amounts, but also had to ban severeal organic/natural pesticides growers were using that were toxic to humans in trace amounts...like arsenic. Arsenic is an organic pesticide. Are you okay with consuming trace amounts of arsenic daily? Probably not. Thankfully for you, neither is the FDA cuz organic producers are just as greedy as conventional ones.

Any pesticide's base function is to kill living things, natural or not. The poison is in the dose. Botulinum toxin is my favorite example of this. One gram of it can kill a million people. It's natural existence is why we don't allow babies to eat any kind of honey (organic, all natural, whatever, actually fake honey would be less of a risk). But manufacture it synthetically, and you have botox.

Natural =/= better. Nature really didn't take into consideration your mortality when it started forming. Some of nature, a lot of it actually, actively tries to kill humans. It's why we need shelter, hand washing, pesticides, and modern medicine to achieve what is now considered normal life expectancy. When life was all natural centuries ago, people died a lot younger."
"> They didn't control for this very obvious bias which is why the conclusion of the study says ""further research is necessary to determine the underlying cause in this association.""

I already called out that lack of that control in my original comment. Please read my full comment before responding. 

> Of course correlation isn't causation. Eating organic produce can correlate with income or general attitude towards health, which can explain the decreased risk. But it could also be the lower toxicity of organic pesticides at the trace amounts allowed by the EPA.

It seem like the meta review you linked supports my point.

> Significant positive outcomes were seen in longitudinal studies where increased organic intake was associated with reduced incidence of infertility, birth defects, allergic sensitisation, otitis media, pre-eclampsia, metabolic syndrome, high BMI, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The current evidence base does not allow a definitive statement on the health benefits of organic dietary intake. However, a growing number of important findings are being reported from observational research linking demonstrable health benefits with organic food consumption. Future clinical research should focus on using long-term whole-diet substitution with certified organic interventions as this approach is more likely to determine whether or not true measurable health benefits exist.

Eating organic food correlates with better health outcomes. It could be because of what *I originally* described above, that people who eat organic food are generally more health conscious, or it could be that eating trace amounts of synthetic pesticides over a long period of time to actually contribute to worse health outcomes. We don't have the data to say which it is right now. Until we do it's a rational decision to hedge your risks by paying extra money to buy organic produce."
"We do have the data. You can look at the thousands of studies that link obesity, tobacco use, and alcohol use to these ailments and they explain the difference between ""organic and conventional"" diets. The trends of obesity and disease over decades correlating with increasingly unhealthy diets. All pathologies are greatly reduced by healthier lifestyle habits exclusive of organic produce. I would argue if you were to plot organic to conventional (not counting for general diet) versus disease on a graph, and overlay a graph of average BMI compared to obesity versus disease prevelance, they would be identical.

You also failed to touch on the fact that natural pesticides have been shown to cause harm in trace amounts and have been banned. So I'm kinda curious where buying organic is a rational decision when the FDA has had to force organic producers to stop poisoning people. Seems really risky to me.

It's also not a rational decision financially when so many struggle to even afford conventional produce. When faced with the fallacy that conventional produce is bad for you, what do those most vulnerable to obesity and related health ailments eat?

At the end of the day, *if* organic produce actually has an impact on health, it is so miniscule it can't even be measured and is effectively irrelevant. There is also risk that natural chemicals meant to kill living organisms might be harmful to humans in trace amounts, the same as synthetic. Which makes it nowhere near worth the financial investment."
"Organic doesn't really mean much for most products. My parents looked into it for their farm and for things like eggs, it just meant not washing them with some chemicals, but others were fine. Same for produce, many organic vegetables are still treated with herbicides or insecticides.

The rules aren't exactly clear cut and there are exceptions for everything.

https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/organic/national-list

https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/anr-69

But to answer your question, co-op and farmers markets are one way, but a lot of farmer's market vendors are not organic, if any, and zero way to actually know if they are. The only sure way to get organic is to grow yourself.

Or just wash the produce from the store really well."
"Several organic farmers markets around the US and Canada have been found to be buying there produce from the local distributors the same as regular grocery stores. They just swap the boxes for their own label and pub stickers that say Organic or similar buzz words. It is a serious problem. A friend's family used to own several farmers markets that only bought from actual local farmers. They only allowed honey sellers who had their own hives and NOT people who just sold the exact same jars you can buy at walmart. (seriously, exact same honey) they often has HFCS added in) And for twice as much as you can buy it at wm. That is bottled in factories where ever, but certainly not local. They almost artnered with a family that owned several other farmers markets. But after visiting them, they saw employees swapping out the boxes from the big distributors for the grocery stores and putting them in baskets ect. Having things that are no way in season in our area, but labeling it as local produce. So they decided not to merge. In the end, they sold their locations because when you do things legitimately, you cannot hope to make the money that the scammers make. And they would hear people comment things like. ""these strawberries and watermelons are beautiful, and the samples taste amazing. But the farmers market down the road is cheaper."" or ""They dont have avocados, lets go to the other place."" in December. And shit like that. 

They always worked with real small farmers ect...

But the rebublican leadership in Texas AND the rest of the USA has been steadily killing small farms. By basically allowing large farming corporations to get away with shit they should be shut down for, and giving HUGE tax breaks to them and so forth. While CLAIMING they care about the little farms."
Grow it yourself.
And there's a huge recall on organic carrots right now for e coli.
Yeah bro but it's organic e coli.
"Yeah, when you can't use chemical fertilizers, you're left with things like composted manure.....and it's a lot cheaper if they don't compost it properly."
"Organic produce still uses chemical fertilizers and pesticides. They just have to be ""natural"" instead of ""synthetic."" It's all still poison (or it wouldn't kill pests) and the natural pesticides require even more liberal application because they aren't as effective."
"Yeah, that compost tea that some people brew up is LOADED with bacteria.

All because a lot of dipshits just want to suckle the orange mango anus's ball sack and destroy all the progress we have made in the last 80 to 120 years or so. 

Yes, the FDA needs to be regulated BETTER! But to dismantle it completely would be as asinine and ignorant as dismantling the Dept of Education. Or the FBI, CIA, NSA, and so on... all because they keep finding crimes that are being done by putrid and puny minded politicians. 

And before anyone says the moronic repub war cry of. ""So and so democrat did blah blah too."" I reply, FINE, throw their ass in jail too. Or the dumber war cry of ""Hunter Biden..."" My reply. SO fucking what. HB hasnt worked for the government since the Clinton administration. His daddy never gave him a cushy job at the White house.

"lol.  ""Organic"" doesn't mean free of microbes."
"""Organic"" means fuckall. There's no standards."
"It's also highly toxic depending on the pesticides they use. Some are really bad for everything but aren't synthetic so they use them in order to keep the ""organic"" label."
Source?
"There are 4 levels of toxicity warning signal words -- Danger (the highest), Poison, Warning, and Caution.

Plenty of organic *icides carry the highest toxicity levels. Take lime-sulfur for example. A completely organic and effective fungicide that's used quite extensively yet carries the ""DANGER"" toxicity signal word. The non-organic alternative, Armada 50 WDG carries only a ""CAUTION"" label.

Some other dangerous, but highly used organic pesticides include pyrethrin, copper sulfate, azadirachtin, chlorhexidine, furosemide, and one of my favorites, Rotenone, which has links to Parkinson's disease.

Organic does not mean ""safe"" or ""pesticide/chemical free."""
"You're right, it doesn't mean safe or chemical free it means ""The purchaser of this item believes it's worth 60% more because we added a keyword""

I'm willing to bet there are stores which move non-organic produce to the organic section to make more money."
"> furosemide

I love that Lasix a commonly used diuretic is also used as a pesticide."
"Peridex, the topical antiseptic used a *lot* by dentists to treat gingivitis, is also on that list.

Medical use is like, 0.1% concentration, though, compared to chlorhexidine diacetate (fungicide) which is ~2%."
"Oh yeah, I love trivia like this. So than you."

Instead we get Karen who was voted class president in 7th grade and has been riding that power high ever since.

What would we expect from a country that allows up to 30% of our food to be sawdust? Lmao we’re absolutely cooked here
"Organic, period. There are no benefits to it whatsoever and it’s generally worse for the environment. It takes significantly more land and water to grow organically than using conventional methods. 

Likewise with “non-GMO.” GM crops are one of our best shots at combatting climate change and hunger by allowing us to grow more, healthier food with fewer resources. Thinking GM crops can hurt you makes about as much sense as thinking that eating eggs will turn you into a chicken."
really? never new of this
They were never meaningful to begin with
"Not to mention organic is worse for the environment because it uses more land (decreasing biodiversity, etc)"
"I totally understand the point about the official certification being watered down but when I go to a farmers market and get local organic produce it is a miraculous delicious produce experience compared to buying the tasteless stuff in mega chain grocery stores. The farmers I’m friends with gladly put in the sweat and blood to get certified, and yeah their amazing produce was delicious and healthy before that but it still does mean something and they’re proud to display their certification."
The only organic thing i buy is milk because it lasts longer
How have the regulations changed? I wasn't aware of them becoming less stringent. Seems like the kind of thing that would get a lot of attention.
In whose interest would it be to make sure it gets a lot of attention?
"Can you just answer the question? I'm not really interested in arguing about that. I want to know how organic food regulations have changed, so I can decide whether or not to change which groceries I buy."
"It's not that they've 'changed' so much as they've always been written and structured in a way that lets producers secure the 'organic' label without it actually meaning what buyers think it means.

"The first article talks about how a small % of organic products don't mean the standards set out by the guidelines, either because of cross contamination with non organic produce, gaps of enforcement, or fraud from foreign exporters. 

The last article's main point on healthiness of food is 

> They [the meta study] concluded that fruits and vegetables that met the criteria for “organic” were on average no more nutritious than their far cheaper conventional counterparts, nor were those foods less likely to be contaminated by pathogenic bacteria like E. coli or Salmonella.

Those are definitely things to take into account, but I don't think they back up your original statement that organic food regulations are meaningless. In response to the first article I would say, nobody should expect regulations to be followed 100% of the time. There are always a small amount of violations. That doesn't change the fact that the vast majority of organic produce is in compliance.

In response to the last article I would say that increased nutrition or decreased bacterial contamination was never really a goal of organic regulations. An apple is an apple, regardless of which pesticides you use, and no produce should have bacterial contamination. The concern with non organic produce is the pesticides possibly are more likely to create long term health problems for people who ingest them."

They only really looked to see if you followed basic food safrty guidelines and ensured you had updated organic certs on hand.
The only one I kinda trust is QAI, because NSF is actually fairly thorough in their inspections, and was the only one we ever failed.

Tbh tho, if you just look through what is allowed to be used via the USDA's regulatory website it's already pretty disheartening. Then, meanwhile, we weren't able to certify palm oil sourced from palm trees that were grown strictly organically for 10 years, because the sapling had been grown with restricted synthetic fertilizer at the beginning of its growth.

Organic is basically a big pile of marketing misinformation. Organic producers like to talk about what they **could*** do for pest control, but most just hose super deadly (but natural!) poison all over everything. The same type of produce can taste different depending on the specific variety and how it was grown. Being Non-Organic doesn't mean they didn't grow a good crop, it just means they didn't meet some arbitrary standards. Non-Organic / GMO produce are just as healthy, and capable of tasting just as good or better than organic produce. Any perceived difference between the these labels is psychological caused by marketing. There are plenty of videos of someone cutting a fruit in half, labeling one half as organic and the other half as GMO, and people who believe in Organic will rave about how much better that half tastes until being told it's the same fruit. 

>provide alternatives?

The only real alternative is to learn to grow your own food, or find a local farmer you can trust. Careful though, I've heard of scammers selling grocery store foods as ""locally grown"" at farmers markets. There are methods of growing most crops that can be done in pots if you're in an apartment. When you buy food from a grocery store, just get non-organic. It's cheaper and just as good."

"Had a bizarre series of these years ago.

As a kid, my mum got me a single stock in Cadbury's as a silly novelty. It was worth pennies, but was pretty cool to be able to claim I owned a share in the chocolate company.

In my early 20s, suddenly I got a phone call from a company attempting a hostile takeover of Cadburys. They were trying to buy up all forgotten shares from small shareholders. Pretty convincing, they were offering me almost 30% higher than the share value (about £0.50 per share) which didn't raise any red flags - if anything I didn't think it would be worth my time.

They then informed me that my dividends had been too small (fractions of pennies) to be sent and had thus been reinvested into more shares. Apparently each share held in the mid 90s was now a few dozen shares. They hadn't asked me for anything, so still no red flags.

A few weeks later they contacted me with a final offer of about £170. Apparently my shares had multiplied when they merged with Schweppes - a merger I didn't know about but proved real when googled. Not a problem, I was happy to send them the address of my local post office where I could collect the check and fill out any relevant paperwork. That one share worth pennies had multiplied to £170 seemed suspicious, but they hadn't asked for anything other than reasonable sounding paperwork so I wasn't bothered.

They emailed me the paperwork, in which it transpired my shares were worth £1,700 due to a miscalculation earlier in the process. Rolling my eyes I read the rest, and was less surprised than I'd hoped to find that I had to wire them a 10% ""deposit"" to validate my account details.

Honestly, the amount of time I'd spent on the phone didn't feel worth the £170 to me by the end. That they paid someone for that time with no guarantee they'd even get anything out of it baffles me."

Is that the one where they’re playing music over a speaker and they’re miming playing? 
"Yeah. We have a small family that regularly sits outside Fred Meyer (Kroger). The dad ""plays"" an accordion with music playing through a speaker and the mom and kid sit there looking pathetic.

I read a story about a woman in Texas who knows how to play the violin. She brought her violin to one of those guys and asked if she could join in. He kept turning her down and she kept persisting. Eventually he gave in and admitted that he was faking it."
"I manage a grocery store and had some folks try this last year. I had to kick them off the lot. So many people were falling for it, because that speaker was LOUD and the music was great! "
"Wait, this is fake??"
"Yes.   It’s very fake.  If they are playing through a speaker, it’s likely not real."
Oh hell no.  I actually stopped to tell the lady who was with this younger guy how beautifully he played.  This is at a Target next to a HomeGoods.  I love hearing it because it lowkey reminds me of Bridgerton.  The audacity.
Was this in the greater Seattle area? I think I've seen that same family.
"No, Denver.  Cornerstar Target parking lot.  If I see him I'll update this thread."
"I had the exact same experience, it reminded me of bridgerton. Damn it. I never give people money that way bc I assume most of it’s a scam but this one got me"
If you listen they’re usually screeching along to the music but the music is so loud it’s hard to hear.
"Yeah. I work at Walmart, hear them all the time and on occasion they'd stop to take a ""break"". They stopped because they got interrupted by an ad"
"Damn, they’re even scamming the demo version!"
I used to play the violin. It's easy for me to just watch and see if their movements actually match the music.. which I can confirm that they never do.
"A guy at my local supermarket was playing guitar and singing but I could tell he was legit and pretty good. He was doing original songs. I didn’t even know about the scams, this was a few weeks ago, but he was real. No one was giving him any money anyway or barely paying attention. I play guitar, I’m not very good, but I could tell he was really playing. I didn’t give him money(I only carry my bank card)but unfortunately he may have been the guy who was real who had other people ruin it for him."
"Yeah the guitar players I've seen have always been legit. One time tho, there was a guy sitting in front of a Safeway grocery store just strumming the same 3 chords over and over. My husband and I laughed about that one, it was so weird."
Wow are they really everywhere?
"I used to work at target and my biggest pet peeves were these people. For about a month my job was to only clean carts so I frequently watched the doors. Every weekend someone would come up to the door “playing” an instrument. It was a sax,  guitar, and a violin. First thing that clued me in was that the person clearly did not know how to play the guitar. Second, the people who came up came in shifts and shared the same sign. Third, one guy messed up and dropped the guitar but the music kept playing. 

And yet people still donated money."
That only works because the music is really good 😭😭🤣
Holy shit. I thought we had the only one.

"The same can be said for extended appliance warranties. They sell the product on its durability and pride to the brand name. Yet, as soon as you're closing the transaction, it suddenly becomes less reliable? 

Granted, I've bought extended warranties on both appliances and cars. And have certainly had experiences where I've been thankful the product was under warranty. To say it will pay for itself in all situations, however, isn't true. I also don't fault the salesman who has seen the warranty save a customer from spending a lot out of pocket.

I think consumers should be looking at them like a gamble. An extended warranty on my Subaru is like $2K. So I'm making a $2K bet with Subaru that their car will break down faster the time they think it'll break down ...except Subaru determines how much the bet is, and how they define their car breaking down."
"The state sells your registration information to car warranty companies, I’d bet if you go to the state treasurers page you can find the form to buy the info in bulk

Took years after my previous car for the calls to stop.
Years ago i left out the phone number on my latest car registration….. not a single call"
I’ll do you one better: insurance on literally anything you can afford without impacting your monthly budget.
"This 100%, insurance is to protect against hard to recover from incidents, not trivial ones. Adding in an insurance company just adds in a layer of expense and frustration"
"I had one of those companies calling me from multiple numbers several times a day for months. My car is 15 years old, and I didn't want an extended warranty on it when it was new, let alone now. I did actually manage to talk to one of the scammers once and I told them how old my car was. I told them that I did not want an extended warranty for a 15 year old car and told them to not call me again. The calls did not stop. I was just about to change my number when a miracle finally occurred and the calls stopped. No idea what happened, but it's been a few months now, knock on wood."
"I occasionally play along with those for a bit. 

""Your car's warranty is about to expire.""

""I'm pretty sure the warranty expired over a decade ago. It seems your data is out of date.""

""Can I get some more information to update our records?""

""I actually brought it in a couple of months ago for the recall. Your information should be quite current. May I speak to a manager."""
"They called me before, I gave them a fake name, a fake car and they still found me in their system. I knew it was a scam from the beginning but I just wanted to fuck with them. I’m John Smith I own a 2020 Toyota Camry, yeah, not even close but they found me. I wish I would’ve kept going, I just told them that’s my name and I don’t own a 2020 Toyota Camry and hung up."
My favorite is describe the car to them. See how long you can go before they realize you are describing the batmobile.
"Same for home insurance policies. Not the ones your bank makes you get if you have a mortgage - I mean the ones you get mail about constantly, and in super fucked up packaging, like printed on pink paper and worded like a final notice or overdue bill. That shit should be illegal."

wish it wasn't temporarily
Seems a bit extreme
"Can someone explain these things to me?  
Nobody really seems to talk about boxing, ever.  I can go two years without remembering boxing exists.

Then suddenly HOLY CRAP YOU GUYS, MAYWEATHER VS PACHINKO, OMG OMG and everybody is *really hyped* about boxing for a week. Then the match happens, it's boring, everyone forgets boxing exists a week later."
"You've already heard the word for it, they are called ""influencers"". It's because they know how to influence.

They are celebrities with large dedicated fanbase who will talk/promote anything they do. And by being deliberately controversial, they attract lots of haters too, who will do free advertising for them non-stop 24/7 by calling them names on social media. They also have advertising budgets that they use to promote the thing further through social media and news outlets.

You don't hear about other boxing matches as  much because most boxers are not influencers and their promoters just aren't as good at playing the media and generating outrage to get stupid people to promote them."
"I miss the days of boxing matches, where boxing was really good. Couldn’t even tell you who is out there or who any middleweight/heavyweight champions are."
"The boxing days when you had Ali, Foreman, Frazier, Norton, Hagler, Hearns, Leonard, and Duran."
"The Barrios-Ramos fight on Friday, in the lead up to the Tyson-Paul fight, was *really* good. It's worth catching."
"How about the scam I fell for :( The fraud department of my bank calling me, alerting me to fraudulent charges happening on my card. I’ve had my identity stolen before, so I wasn’t surprised snd was just grateful they found the charges early on. I googled the number and it was the same # as my bank.

They had identifying info about me that not just anyone would have and asked me verifying questions after that my bank asks me any time I have called them before. It was so, so believable and I was already in a stressed mental state prior to the call. When I called my bank directly the next day, even the employee told me it was legitimate. It wasn’t until I called again that an employee dug into their logs of texts/calls to me that they determined it was fake. Luckily, I was only out about 1.5 hours of my time in total with talking to the scammer, changing card and bank numbers, updating accounts, etc and didn’t lose a dime.

Main lesson I learned: If your bank calls you for ANY reason, hang up and call them directly. Don’t be dumb like me.

Edited to add: When they were sending me texts to verify things / help me add the card alerts to my phone, the confirmation texts came from a number that I’ve gotten legitimate texts from my bank before. They’re too smart!!"
"I don't even take calls anymore from anyone. I let it ring out and then I will call them back. If I know them, I will text them back. If it is my folks, I will facetime with them."
"I normally ignore every single call, I just so happened to answer this one. I had anxiety for weeks about the situation and wished that I had my phone on do not disturb at that point in time, then none of this probably would have happened!"
"Yes, I had this one, too. They called to allegedly double check whether I made a purchase of (enough for a tank of gas), in (a part of town I never go, but is known for more than a little card fraud), checking if it was a verified purchase. They were very good about reminding me they would never ask for my password, confirmation code, or username, they sounded legit, everything. I was skeptical, but not so skeptical as to hang up, right until the confirmation that I had the phone number text message. Told them I didn’t recognize the number from which it came (never got a text from it before, and I’m signed up for text alerts for every transaction), so give me a moment to verify it wasn’t a scammer—*click!* They were the ones who hung up."
"Okay so my mom got a text like that and asked me if it was legit and I told her no, ignore it. Then they started calling her cell and she started panicking and told her to call the bank herself. THEN her landline started ringing from them and got her even more excited but I didn’t let her answer it, I just told her to call the number on the card for the bank. It was real but she didn’t need to panic. Just because my mom didn’t answer any of the 3 within a 15 minute span doesn’t mean they shrugged and went “guess that $300 purchase to a sketchy foreign site was legit”. Stay calm and call the bank yourself."
">When I called my bank directly the next day, even the employee told me it was legitimate.

How on Earth?!

Sometimes I forget that scammers can spoof legit numbers..."
The employee probably just checked that the phone number was theirs and didn't consider spoofing themself.
"I had no idea that they could do this, which is why I googled the number while I was on the phone with the scammer!"
No transactions or subscriptions should be made from the phone. any change in an account or insurance can be informed by mail. Just be smarter than that. Don't let old people handle phone calls on their own.
I’m not old :( Young enough to know better for sure! Scammers got me at a good time. Just glad they didn’t get any $$
"I wonder if the scammers got all of that unique information from a data breach. I got a letter from my credit union early this year telling me that my information, including contact info, account/card numbers, SSN, etc., had been included in a data breach. (Unfortunately I'm an idiot who never remembers to open my mail, so I just discovered this a couple of days ago. 🤦)

Add to that the ability to easily find legit bank phone numbers and then spoof them, well, there you go. That's an insidious one because it is so much more believable than the usual scam."
I suspected this after the fact! My info was leaked in a breach a few months prior to this happening. I literally have the worst luck with that
"Healing crystals. If anything, they've become even more popular recently.

Edit: Having said that, I *have* seen them be very effective as tools to effect introspection and discussion about mental health, basically operating as a fun, dialectical abstraction of psychological concepts that might be too complicated or daunting to address directly. But it's a slippery slope to letting this abstraction become a real, significant part of how you live your life."
"I believe in them. 

What I do is find the biggest healing crystal I can and throw them hard at people I don't like. Leaves a really bad mark.

I find it heals the soul."
"To the people that don't believe that rocks can't have magical powers, go smoke crack and tell me that it's not magic"
It magically makes your money disappear poof!
Followed by your possessions. *Poof!* Then the money and possessions of those close to you who trust you (for now) *Poof!* Followed by your complexion. *Poof!* And your teeth. *Poof!* Y’all got anymore of that magic?
But you can get so much done in a day!
"there are rocks that have scientifically proven auras...

unfortunately those rocks are Uranium and the aura is cancer."
Hahaha 😆
Oh shit. I have been misusing them wrong apparently. I can see how it would heal my soul.
My ex became completely detached from reality after she got into healing crystals and Reiki.    It’s a weird rabbit hole for some people.
"I looked some of them up, I was considering buying selenite last year...it's gypsum, it's basically sheetrock and if you get it wet it dissolves. But to crystal people, it's supposed to protect you from bad energy or something. I think if people like the pretty rocks, that's cool. But expecting them to have healing properties or whatever is silly. 

I did end up buying some selenite, it sits on my desk and looks kind of cool. 

But I do feel like I basically overspent on raw drywall materials, at $6 for this little 3"" crystal."
They're still neat decorations. Some guy posts on Reddit sometimes of crystals he grows himself out of whatever he can find. Even the table salt he made into a large crystal was cool.
"Gotta be hella careful tho, my cousin blew up his trailer just last week while growing some crystals without proper equipment "
Idiots always skipping out on a proper vent hood....
holup
"My wife recently got into these.  Like sometimes in the last few years she just started collecting them. Then she started putting them under the moonlight to charge or whatever. I thought it was fun at first,  but one night it was the harvest moon and she pretty much had an anxiety attack over not finding one particular rock that was the most important to put under the moon. I was like,  ""hey,  you know all that's fake right? Like these rocks are just rocks not magic?""


Yeah that was an argument.

Now my oldest daughter is getting into them,  and she now will not be able to sleep unless she has her sleep rock under her pillow. It actually caused a huge problem when she lost the rock and was purposefully staying up at night to prove how exhausted she was without the rock. I had the same talk with her,  about how it is not real and it's supposed to be a fun little thing you do. Once it actually negatively affects your mood then it's no longer a fun little thing. Another argument because I was being a hypocrit since Mom believes in the rocks and I don't tell her otherwise. Only because we don't like to hash things out in front of our kids,  but damn they're just rocks."
"It’s pretty though. Saying it’s drywall is like saying that a nice ceramic vase is just mud. It’s not the molecules that matter, it’s how they are arranged."
">But to crystal people, it's supposed to protect you from bad energy or something. I think if people like the pretty rocks, that's cool. But expecting them to have healing properties or whatever is silly.

I've got two local rock shops. One sells cool rocks and crystals. One sells miracle cures. I don't like being the skeptic stick in the mud to my nephew's rock and crystal collecting, but I sure as shit aren't taking him to the ""healing crystal shop.""

I like pretty rocks, like, a lot. You can just stare at them an meditate. There's no reason to pretend like they've got magical properties! I mean, go look at a slab or cabochon of BC Ocean Picture Stone and you can see an ocean scene. Maybe eat some mushrooms first. That's totally valid and can help center you! A chunk of quartz on a necklace isn't going to help you heal faster, but looking at an opal can calm your thoughts!"
"> my nephew's rock and crystal collecting

Aww this is cool, and geology is not a bad field. I know a guy who majored in that and he gets to drill like, dirt layer samples in Colorado now."
"I love the look of lit up salt stones, they look absolutely fantastic.

Unfortunately, I can't buy them without looking like a nutcase."
"Selenite can still be really cool! The satin spar crystal type basically looks like a chunk of fiber optic. 

You should look into growing your own bismuth crystals! They look really wild."
It’s such a strange white woman grift
"I know a bunch of brown women who are into reiki and crystals, horoscope charts, etc. It's weird. I thought we knew better than this lol."
"It falls into the category of people believe it because they want to believe it. Along with astrology/horoscopes/homeopathy ect. 

Desire for something to be true seems to have much greater sway for many people then objective research based facts."
That's both racist and ignorant
"So you're saying you've never seen ghetto witches and all the damaged hoes that are into crystals, spells, weird fake pagan/african relgions, read ""The Secret"" and Syliva Brown, and buy lots of hamsas and evil eye merch?  It's like 20% of instagram content these days.  I'd say it's more of a ghetto thing these days than a white chick thing."
Is the opposite of a white woman a “ghetto” or “damaged hoe”? What even is a damaged hoe?
">What even is a damaged hoe?

Usually means a trip to Tractor Supply or the nearest hardware store, in my experience"
"I \*love\* watching/listening to reki/healing crystals videos. It's so sincere sounding and these you-tubers spout the most outlandish crap about rocks and chakras in such a calm and pleasant manner. Soo much of it is so well spoken in a crazy way. ""Thank you rose quartz for guiding me to this place of peace...'"

"I think that crystals (etc) are kind of fun, like a lucky charm, but the idea that they could heal your cancer is just…"
I knew someone who was leaving them on the floor under the bed etc in specific patterns. Even after her baby was starting to get mobile. Never found out if he choked on one.
What was her reasoning for that?
"I think she was having some kind of post-partum psychosis. She was acting pretty strangely, refusing to let one set of grandparents hold the baby etc. I hope she found a therapist. But we weren't very close friends so I just sort of dipped out. Her husband and her mom seemed very stressed by her behavior."
Thats really sad. I hope she got help
"it's fun to find out what they'e used for, but i don't have an intention of 'using' them for that. It's like knowing what canopic jars hold what organ. Fascinating, but im not gonna go around shoving guts into jars."
"I don't even give a fuck if you own a crystal with some type of placebo affect like I don't give a fuck but when it's shit like anxiety cos okay comfort item

But when you're buying them and actually convinced these rocks cure you insane"
"I carry a ""special rock"" and a chunk of amethyst in my bag. I like to touch things for reassurance and focus when I'm feeling crazy. I like to think about the forces that made the rocks. They ain't curing anything but anything that brings your attention to the moment is good! But people be insane like ""this common quartz will HEALLLLLL and it's only $99."" No, Janet. It's literally from your gravel driveway."
I have a lot of rocks and crystals but it’s because I found them and have biology magpie issues.
Same. Wait til I tell you about my driftwood collection.
Guilty too.
"Just like tarot, runes, etc. A good introspection and thought tool, either on your own or with a good guide. A lot of times the diviners can easily tell if it's a therapy session, for fun, or if you actually believe it, and will change how they act accordingly. 

Personally, when I'm indecisive, a quick pull of the runes helps me decide. Or if I just need a direction/guide to think about a problem. 

The thing is, it's all symbolic and metaphorical stuff. You can make a rune casting or tarot reading mean whatever you want, as long as it's the vague ""guideline"" the table has on it. But it gets you thinking how to piece it together, and that thinking can be really constructive."
"Especially since most crystals in the quartz family (amethyst, citrine, smokey, rose, rudilated etc) are obtained through strip-mining delicate ecosystems because it's cheaper"
"They've moved on to magic socks and mystical skin patches, now.

I wish I was kidding.

I was at a local Christmas craft market this weekend, and a lady was full on drunk on that kool-aid. ""Drug free, chemical free patch that does X"" where X runs the gamut from 'increased focus', 'alertness and memory', 'help sleeping', 'stress relief', etc. through some hocus pocus snake oil shit about nerve ending stimulation patterns."
"Strangely enough they can help even if it’s just by way of placebo affect. The mind is a strange strange thing. A recent study showed that nurofen marketed for specific aliments 
 such as period pain, headaches etc and was more expensive that the normal packaging but had EXACTLY the same ingredients had a significant greater affect on pain relief. Like I said - the mind is a weird thing."
Yes and it's supposed to help you with all this good energy it transmits. How about the energy of the child or underpaid labourer who puts his life in danger to get them out of the ground? If I run into people I tell them about or show them [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/17/healing-crystals-wellness-mining-madagascar).
"Funny enough I got into this trend and only stopped because my toddler beamed me upside the head with one. 
I suddenly decided rocks were a dumb thing to have around children."
This like a bot answer. Completely unrelated to my answer and loosely related to the parent comment.
It’s just a funny thing to think about when I remember I did get into healing crystals. And why I stopped.
"It's funny reason to stop indeed, I'll give you that haha."
"Healing crystals are a good sign that we are not going to get along, fundamentally"
Glue them to your steering wheel and turn your airbag into a healing claymore!

Placebo effect works. I do ""Magick"" but I'm 99.999% sure it's placebo. The key is to not spend money on it and make your store of energy a quarts containing pebble that looks cool to you and your ""wand"" a stick you find on the ground. Don't fall for baloney. In my mind, spirituality is a chemical process in the brain that allows you to heal mentally and process things- similar to worship service and prayer in Christianity."
I agree with all of this :)
"I live in Flagstaff, and the entire city of Sedona down the road is basically built up on the entire crystal/vortex scam. It's actually quite remarkable to witness."
"I find them to be an excellent placebo effect that costs little money and leaves you with pretty rocks all over your house. As far as scams go, they are probably the best. Of course, you have to buy the cheaper ones, and I do."
"I was given a spherical, clear crystal (golf ball size) 20 years ago by a friend who was having some issues with life (think depression, no job, failed university, broken down marriage etc.).  Always kept it as it was a cool sphere.

But now, it has actually done wonders helping my girlfriend heal her Plantar fasciitis (heel pain caused by inflammation of tissue that runs under the base of the foot).  She stands on it which stretches the tissue and it's the perfect size for getting in exactly the right places.  I'm not sure that's how these healing crystals are supposed to heal, but this one has definitely done a good job with the healing!"
"> Having said that, I have seen them be very effective as tools to effect introspection and discussion about mental health, basically operating as a fun, dialectical abstraction of psychological concepts that might be too complicated or daunting to address directly.

Pretty much a spot on description of tarot card, too."
"As someone that works with crystals, the issue is when people stop seeing it as an AID and start replacing medical science and professional help. 

A lot of work you’d use with them (as an overall of the many contexts they’re used in) doesn’t even absolutely require crystals. Visualization and other tools like frequencies can be just as effective.

Anything with crystals that claims to cure and treat anything, even moreso any actual conditions or ailments is definitely not legit. A lot of times in communities when people are having medical problems will tell you not to just rely on spiritual work or alternative medicine alone "
"Well said. I fear that line between the crystal/spiritual/metaphorical realm and real science is, unfortunately, often blurred by ignorant and/or exploitative actors."
"I like them. I vibe with some of them. I don’t expect them to cure anything serious, but neither does meditating or herbal tea. But they can all feel nice to have."
"Hey, I have rocks I use at work that really **do** have special properties! They emit energies I use to ensure my radiation detectors are working properly!"

"Oh I've def seen that, haha (Tom Scott is a legend). I think I know what you're getting at, but explain more about how that concept/video is relevant"
"Crystals, salt lamps, lava lamps…all that groovy semi-mystical stuff that doesn’t actually do anything - except in this one case, the lava lamps actually do something practical with a real-world measurable benefit."
"Did/do people buy lava lamps for healing? I always though it was just because it looks cool. Also, crystals obv have tons of important real-world uses"
But what about ear candling? And those 'foot detox' pads? No crystal package is complete without the whole package.
"I'm looking for Galena crystals, but it's so I can show my neighbor's kid how to build a crystal radio set. That's the real stuff that heals the soul."
They just look so dang cool but no one thinks adding flame graphics to a car cures cancer for some reason
I just think they're neat. Crystals look cool and are fun as decoration.
"I collect them because I like weird, pretty shit like bugs, crystals, and bones. I just think they're neat."
"The hard part about this is, crystals are bs, but the placebo effect has some merit. If people need a material scapegoat to believe in hard enough to get some small placebo boost, maybe that's... something? If it's healing they want though, there are probably some better treatments that could actually solve the problem."
It’s funny you say this because I use crystals when I meditate. I have a whole set up of crystals and trinkets and candles except I don’t believe in their healing power voodoo. I use them because they are pretty and it’s something I can look at and focus on to get into the right mindset to meditate. Same with the trinkets. They are little things that are meaningful to me. I was always very weirded out by people that get super into crystals. I was a massage therapist and there were a LOT of those people at my school. 
"It is weird to me how much hate they get.

I am not into them but to me it basically seems like religion without all the kid fucking and hatred towards the LGBQT community. Some people wear a cross around their neck and hold it while they pray, some people wear a crystal around their neck and ""feel its vibrations"" or whatever while they meditate. People worship and believe in lots of things that have no clear basis in reality, and to me at least crystals seem like *by far* one of the least harmful."
Theve become more popular because people are desperate for relief and can’t get it from drs due to the insane anti opioid hysteria since the 2016 cec opioid guidelines
NFTs 😭
People are still buying those?
"They have evolved.  Now, artists are being approached about creating NFT.  The artists are asked if they want to have a great money-making opportunity by licensing old comics as NFTs.  All they need to do is pay a small fee and upload their art.  Some of my favorite web comics have been approached.  Some actually got scammed. The idea of pay now, so that someone would buy the NFT later is toxic."
"Bruh my grad school professor was bragging to us he was coming out with some. Never dropped to my knowledge, thankfully."
"NFTs are a DRM technology. My airline loyalty card is an NFT. The technology itself is not a scam.

What you probably meant was digital images protected with NFTs DRM and sold for insane amounts of money, as if useless images being protected with a DRM makes them any more valuable -- those are indeed a scam."
"I wouldn't call them a scam in essense. They're quite comparable to crypto for example. If people are interested in it than it holds value. The whole being assosiated with an image is unnecessary to me and makes people able to say ""you buy a digital image, what a scam"". It's of course not about the image but about the blockchain, which confirms ownership. It's easily comparable to art for example, except that you can just generate more NFT's and sell them to people if you just have a brand. I guess that's where it becomes a scam...

And no, I would never buy an NFT."
Political propaganda.
"Unfortunately, no one is immune to propaganda."
"It’s harder to see propaganda that aligns with your world view, and easier to spot propaganda that conflicts with your worldview, but all propaganda can definitely be objectively discerned.

One thing that makes it difficult though is that people don’t know everything, so in the areas where we don’t have any information, we might be naive and easy to dupe.

——-——

edit: this also applies to areas where we have bad information, whether outdated, fallacious logic, misinformation, or disinformation. We are easily duped when propaganda plays toward this or builds upon disinformation that has been instilled over time.

second edit: it would be more accurate if I were to use the word “deceitful”. I know that not all propaganda is deceitful, such as ads to get people to stop drinking and driving, or political messages for the masses that are honest, as those can certainly exist.

Politics is quite dirty. There are a lot of decitful people in politics. So don’t go blindly believing that what politicians tell you and which fits into their self interest is accurate. But don’t assume that everything a politician tells you is a lie either. You need to check things out for yourself by checking out information from many sides or by comparing the source information with what politicians and news outlets say about it. Then you can determine for yourself who has a habit of lying.

here is the essence as an analogy: you’re in elementary school and Cynthia hastes Sue. Cynthia tells everyone that Sue eats bugs in the field everyday after school. You have caught Cynthia lying before about you so you know that Cynthia sometimes lies. This is logical information. You decide to look For yourself and secretly spy on sue (you’re five) for a few days after elementary school in the field as she leaves and you see for yourself that she doesn’t eat bugs. This is sensory information. Of course, the limitation is that you only spent a few days looking for yourself, but you saw that at least part of what Cynthia said is false. you now have a few good reasons to suspect Cynthia is lying.

tldr: politicians benefit from you believing what they tell you. We need to find logical ways to discern truth rather than building up a mental map based on the words of others. If you fact check lies with another liar, or a mindless repeater, you’ll just be more entrenched in a lie."
Oliver sacks! People  with brain injury knew the politician on tv was lying. https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-may-11-mn-28901-story.html
Very interesting! Thanks for this link
That’s basically echo chamber and experimenter bias. You corroborate with others who think like you and only look for evidence which confirms your theory. 
"fact checking lies with lies is, yes. 

Like you’re indicating, agreement doesn’t equal truth, no matter how much of it there is. At one point just about everyone agreed the world was flat. You have to check every assumption and make sure it is grounded in more than the air that comes from peoples mouths.

compare edited clips to the whole clip. Compare reports to the events being reported on."
"You just gotta balance it out. Usually every month I do 1 week cycles.


First week is Leni Riefenstahl week,Triumph of the Will, read the old book by that Austrian dude, all that


Then on the second week I read Any Rand and listen to Pinochetist songs while looping Wolf of Wall Street on the background 


Next week it's Eisenstein time, alongside post-WWII Stalinist epic cinema, finishing off with some classic family friendly proletarian fun in the form of the ""East is Red""


By the last week, I'll watch the Barbie movie and read gay furry fanfics as I descend into illuminated centrism at the very end of the month, for a few minutes of absolute and all-encompassing clarity, existing beyond any biased mortal perspective, before I have to go get my copy of Mein Kampf and start the cycle again"
"The thing about a lot of that propaganda is that it takes from legitimate artistic movements that share a similar worldview. It's often a lot more organic than ""let's make up random stuff to fool people"".

Soviet Realism is an example that is (obviously) based on realism, and ""Blood and Soil"" was originally a legitimate artistic movement about romantic nationalism/agrarianism before the Nazis appropriated it (though tbf there was some racist parts in the movement even before that, according to Wikipedia). It's sad because a lot of otherwise good art gets ruined by that context."

Lol! I spend my time in the diorama subreddits.

lol. I really enjoy the thinking of everybody who has responded to this.
"This honestly makes me so sad. Most countries have a two party political system that only gains by polarizing it's population and constantly distracting them from real issues. So many relationships have been broken by mindlessly believing some meaningless afterthought that a politician (especially, a popular one) shouted at national television. Our division is their strength."
">	Most countries have a two party political system

This is exactly the opposite of the truth. Very few countries in the world have two party systems or even multi-party systems where two parties dominate.

In the vast majorities of democratic countries there are many political parties with varying and constantly shifting levels of representation in parliament. America, Britain, and Australia are really the only large countries with this two party dynamic."
"I think you bring up a good point. While politcal parties and their makeup is one matter, some being more honest or virtuous, and some being less so, coupled with somewhat uninformed or illogical masses (I’m talking about people, not just one group of voters) creates a perverse incentive.

A leader should strive to be virtuous and honest in conduct and speech. But cynical people might lie for the vote or vilify people who vote for the other guy.

back to your point, because polarization and truth are two different things (albeit intertwined), though nuance can sometimes be lacking in two party systems for the reasons you described, we can strive to personally have nuance in our interactions with others. 

Don’t seek to put people in boxes, but look for the best in them. What is the best thing about that person you disagree with politically? What are some values you both share? Maybe you have similar values but different information. You can disagree politically and both be good people."
You said it much better than I could.
"I remember when I was a kid, there was a lot more general trust in the society (The one I’m in, and I imagine this is the case in many other places in the west.) It felt like a society of people who were the same, and who generally shared the same values, rather a society of people who were different and isolated from one another or worse, hostile toward each other. When there were personal disagreements about political things it didn’t affect families and friendships like today, it was more like a personal taste matter, not a dealbreaker, and we were all still the same.

I miss that feeling."
"I think a lot of it has to do with the rise in social media (or internet in general) that brought out the worst in a lot of people by creating echo chambers that suggested imminent crisis when there wasn't one. Perhaps this is why I have an obsession for the 80s (the music, movies, books) even though I was born in late 90s.  Things just felt a lot simpler back then. I'm sure there are a lot of biases at play here, but still ..."

"The sheer number of people that were shocked Trump won, shows you just how effective it is.


People need to stop getting their ""news"" from social media.  It's not real.  Stop it."
"A lot of people will not listen to what you say if they disagree with your political stance, but what you said is true.

This is true no matter where in the world one lives.

People shouldn’t rely on social media for news and assume that the information they have been presented with is reliable. 

Especially with proliferation of bots, and the ability to present a false picture. Traditional news media can in and of itself be misleading, be propaganda presented as news, be edited in such a way that it is deceptive in that it looks like you are seeing or hearing something that has happened, but are being led into a false picture of events.

people generally won’t have time to look into the sources used for news and watch unedited footage, read press releases and so forth, but if we do this for a few critical reports on hot button topics, we can determine who lies when they report, and who doesn’t, or who lies about what, minimizing the amount of disinformation we consume."

"When ppl are desperate for a job, they get tunnel vision. 

This is coming from a guy who applied to them and, upon further reflection, realized what they were after being unemployed for a bit."
"Me when I was 22 :( Amazingly, I got back all my money about 7 years later as the government was looking into this particular scam"
You’re lucky! It’s rare that they get the money back
I couldn’t believe it! I thought it was another scam at first. I learned my lesson just that one time!
"After filling out 4000 applications over the last two years, my work email now gets 200 spam messages per day. And that's *after* blocking the addresses."
"My friend recently fell for one of these that was *shockingly elaborate* because they were able to convincingly impersonate the real recruiter for the real job that she really interviewed for.

She's smart and she checked the contact info and the company website and everything looked legit and a few days later the real recruiter put out on LinkedIn that they had been hacked and impersonated (idk how it happened to them). But she was also desperate for a job and didn't understand that money from a check could appear in her account before the check cleared."
"And on top of that. Fake check scams. 

Though the whole thing with chase a few months ago taught me there is a shocking number of people who don't know how checks work...."
"I didn’t fall for one but I made a post about one on Reddit . It’s mostly because the fake job offers scams get your info from specific websites so if you’ve got an email dedicated specifically to working , it’s easy to see how you could end up compromised and questioning the scams"
"I’ve been getting a lot of those lately, seems to have shifted that direction from the standard pig butchering scam"
I'm recently unemployed and I'm *so* nervous about this aspect of job-searching.
i’m surprised people still fall for those fake irs calls demanding gift cards.

Homeopathy.
"Yeah it’s wild how popular it is in Germany. I went to my doctor because I was convinced I had strep and wanted to be tested. She said it was just another cold but that she’d write me a prescription for something that would “help my immune system”. I asked her what that could be and she didn’t really answer. On my way to the pharmacy I realized it was a prescription for homeopathic medication. Yes, they sell that at the real pharmacy. I didn’t bother filling the prescription."
Can you report that doctor for recomending you buy unproven medicine.
"Right?! My Dad has a friend with *serious* health issues. He’s under the care of traditional western medicine which has saved his life, and he also has his homeopathic ‘potions’. Guess what he credits for his health?🤦‍♀️"
The Wedding Industry
Yup. And the Funeral Industry. Big time.
You can add the diamond industry too.
"""Yes, we are aware that synthetic diamonds are lower price and superior quality to natural diamonds, but don't you think that the suffering of the child slave that dug it out of the ground is what makes a gem truly special?"""
Just marketing made diamonds special.
"And the pet industry, and the baby industry. They all prey on emotions"
"We’ve bought probably 90 percent of our baby/children stuff second hand. We also sell it for essentially the same price, sometimes more. The used market for baby stuff is great. Puts it into perspective how much money the new products make."
"Any particular venues or just the usual eBay, FB Marketplace, etc?"
"Marketplace is our go to, but local thrift shops are great as well!"
Add the funeral industry
And they all charge triple at the minimum.
"The baby industry is CRAZY. LUXURY baby gear?! Get outta here. And a lot of it is unsafe. No, I'm it spending $1000 on a bassinet that will be used for 3 months. My hand me down pack n play is perfect and is multi functional."
"We love our pack n play. We have taken it on trips so when we stop he has a safe place to play. (we do road trips a lot) And it works as a 'bassinet', a 'crib', and as an all around place for him to run around and play. We have a regular rectangle one, and a much larger octagonal one."
The funeral industry is the worst 
"If feel this should be its own reply, not piggybacking off someone else's."
"Every single female friend I have who gets married talks to me about their wedding dress, I tell every single one of them to stay away from “wedding dresses” and just look for white dresses…and not a single one has listened.

They can’t get through their head that the word “wedding” means a 400% markup easily."
"I mean, it's not a guarantee that a ""wedding"" dress will be marked up like wild. I think chain stores like David's have fallen out of favor with a *lot* of women, but good deals can be had.

We had a small wedding part (two per side plus us). I got myself and my two groomsmen tailored suits for about $650 each. My wife went to David's Bridal and got her wedding dress plus her two bridesmaids' dresses for less than one of my suits (somewhere in the $500 range out the door for her). She looked an absolute picture at the wedding, and the dress looked phenomenal. And it was absolutely a ""wedding"" dress at the store.

Like anything, YMMV, but I really feel like weddings are as expensive as what you fall for. It was pretty easy for us to make inexpensive choices without compromising the experience for us and our guests. Don't put on the blinders that make you ignore prices. There's a ton of excessively marked up shit, but there's a ton of reasonably priced wedding items out there."
"It depends on what's important to you. I got a lovely wedding dress that luckily wasn't terribly expensive (still more than any other item of clothing I've ever owned). I cheaped out on the photographer and gave a friend $100 to take photos. I also had several good photos taken by my BIL. We found our own caterer from a favorite Italian restaurant. We provided our own alcohol. I think we spent the most on the venue, honestly. My point is, you may not value the wedding dress, but others might."
"My point is, the word “wedding” gives the seller a reason to tack on much extra to the price without any extra cost to themselves or the manufacturers. 

If buying a “wedding dress” is important to you than considering any dress out there, I don’t care. You’re paying a premium for that. That’s my point. 

I’ve made many many wedding cakes, and my bosses talked constantly about how much they could charge because “people will spend more for their wedding”. It’s a racket. There’s no reason for it. When I do wedding cakes on my own for clients, they’re priced the same as any other cake I do, based purely on size and complexity.

Movies and tv have sold it to you over the years and you all buy into it. That’s your business."
"That only works if you want a relatively casual and/or simple wedding dress.  If you really want a super bridal looking ballgown, those are only ever used for weddings, so there's no choice really.  "
I wore a leopard print sundress. $25 at Ross!
"I wouldn’t say the industry itself is a scam. More so that people just overspend and are selfish. We had a great wedding for around $6k, most of which went to the catering/venue. Had every person there we wanted (like almost 200). Don’t regret it one bit. But here’s the thing, the only “wedding industry” exclusive things we got were the dress and bouquet. The photographer was just a regular photographer, the dj a regular dg, flowers were from Kroger(and looked great!), cake was from a local grocery (a simple two tier cake and sheet cake). Cash bar instead of open bar is the only thing we “skimped” on. "
Never get married.
"Honestly, it depends. Marriage is a fiscal arrangement that can be beneficial. It's like a business partnership. Sometimes it's advantageous, sometimes it's not."
"Idk why you're getting downvoted, this is the real pro-tip."
I call it the wedding industrial complex.
This is why any wedding I have will be a birthday as far as any of the vendors know.
Liver Detoxes

Chiropractors. I’ve personally cared for two patients with vertebral artery dissections from chiro adjustments. I’ve known one other outside of work.
"I am scared and will never go to a chiropractor. When I see them jerk people on videos and pop/crack them, it makes me nervous and scared they will paralyze them."
"I remember I saw a youtube video of some chiropractor who worked on some guy's neck and the guy kept saying, ""My neck hurts really bad now!""

Chiropractor kept saying ""That's just because it tore some lesions free, it'll stop hurting in a minute.""  Dude said he was in pain at least twice and the Chiropractor was still like, ""See! I fixed this guy's problems!"" 

I remember thinking why in the hell would he upload this video? The patient  was constantly complaining about being in pain."
They’ll tell you it doesn’t happen but it definitely does. And the waiver you sign absolves them of any liability. What really pisses me off is when parents take their newborn babies and have them adjusted.
"I cannot imagine them working one a baby, who can't even tell them if something hurts or not!"
Yup I had my carotid dissected by having neck ajustment. I should have died but somehow didnt. I have to be careful now w my neck so it doesn't tear again. Never will goto another one. My wife still convinced there safe and thinks mine was just freak accident. But I know truth now there crooks.
"> And the waiver you sign absolves them of any liability.

No, it does not. If you are injured by something a chiropractor does to you, go see a medical malpractice attorney. People can put whatever they want in a waiver, doesn't necessarily make it enforceable."
Ohhh thanks. Didn’t know this. Thank you for the correction
"I saw a video of a barbershop in India where they also do massage and neck cracking.  They broke the guy's neck cracking him, and he was clearly messed up right after... so they offered him some water."
I’m sure he’s doing great now!
I figured out my chiropractor was a scam when I started doing physical therapy and he got mad at me.  Meanwhile the PT is teaching me things to get me well and on my way and this guy is wanting me to keep coming back.  Hmmm.
"My grandfather (father's father) was a chiropractor in the 60s/70s. When my father was a teenager, my grandfather would forcefully do adjustments on him. My father said it was incredibly painful. He had lifelong back problems he blamed on it.

I remember him saying to me when I was a kid, ""Chiropractors are _always_ scams. Do not ever go see one, no matter what, period."""
Why the hell do so many insurances cover chiropractic or acupuncture but not massage? Absolutely baffling.
"It’s wild. Tricare doesn’t cover it except for active duty. I’ve noticed where we have been stationed, chiropractors try to offer discounts for military family members. My husband goes occasionally to the chiro and I beg him to not let them touch his neck. 😭

Now that said, insurance could cover PT where you could do PT manipulation which is safe and effective."
"Also the risk of Air Embolism. 
    
Chiropractors are like mlm's, though, in that MINE IS DIFFERENT mindset. This nurse is done arguing with people. Snake oil won. I don't even argue with my patients unless their idiocy has a less than zero chance of killing them on my shift. Covid laid bare that most Americans would rather straight die than 1. Be told no or 2. Be told they're wrong or 3. Be told to do something mildly uncomfortable/inconvenient. Fucking toddlers. God help you if Aunt Margie said something once about it, because she obviously knows more than them Big City Doctors..."
"Years ago I had lower back problems and went to the chiropractor all the time for ""adjustments"" and massages and I would leave feeling great.  Then I read if you have lower back problems, try going for a walk - when I started walking all my back problems disappeared.  Haven't been back in 8 years."

Yep. It’s so sad.
This is the one. Mind-blowing.
"I've learned how to do the lower lumbar pop myself and it's been a night and day difference in comfort. I usually pop before bed; only when it hurts. Absolutely amazing relief.

So the truth as I've come to see it? Chiropractic adjustments work if the dipshit you hired to do the adjustment takes their time and understands why sudden movements are bad. 90% won't; so avoid them."
Best of luck 🙃
"Thanks, even if you're being sarcastic. Degenerative disk disease is a real bitch."
"I've been seeing one for years and do get momentary relief, which could probably be extended with PT. Getting distraction (pulling up the chin and head to release the spine) feels amazing."
Or alternatively go to a physical therapist or real doctor and they deal with the underlying issue so you don't need to go back to them again and again for years.
"I love my chiropractor, specifically because she doesn't wrench me around at ALL, she uses a little thumper thing. She's never twisted me around like a pretzel and cracked me, but I've been to plenty that do... No thank you, that doesn't feel safe at all!"
"Gotta be careful with that too. [check this out](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9197740/) 

I recommend seeing a PT. They are trained in “manipulation” which is a safe and studied method to assist in pain relief. I’d def look into it!"
Chiropractors as a concept aren’t scams. They’re just usually reckless
Ummm I think the promise that the adjustment helps people and they continue to pay for it constitutes a scam. Also the origin of chiropractic work is based on pure quackery.
"That’s the thing , while it’s origins are iffy it’s concept is actually solid. The problem with chiropractics is that the people are reckless but also it’s still relatively new as a form.  
It just needs a better understanding as it does actually help people when used properly"

It is crazy to think about what all the major religions could accomplish with all their money.
That's all religion.
"Just every religion, especially the Christian ones."
"That’s not actually  true . Religion itself isn’t necessarily the scam . The scam is in the preachers using it to justify their own greed and hatred and congregations just going along with it. That’s why people like Kenneth Copeland , the guys who sell holy water , and and other famous religious zealots can all be fact checked against their own religion proving them as nothing but scammers . 

They take advantage of the fact that most people don’t actually read their holy texts unless they’re in service . As such the preachers can say what ever they want and most people will go along with it . They’re hypocrites. That’s why if you look at the root of the problem with most people who suffer from religious trauma , it boils down to what ever religious group they’re a part of being hypocritical. Whether a person was sexually assaulted , punished due to some “ ism “,  or just simply shamed due to a random action they committed or some other reason , the issue bottles down to hypocrisy .

the catch is , these horrible people would be horrible with or without religion . They’re just weaponizing religion to achieve their goals . Kinda like Eric cartman in South Park does with Christianity . He actively weaponized it when ever he can , but never actually cares about it or tries to make a change in a good way ."
"Okay but what do they get out of banning coffee?

I could understand banning *caffeine* because it's an addictive psychoactive drug. But they don't ban caffeinated soft drinks. They say it's because of scripture banning ""hot beverages"" or something, except iced coffee that was cold-brewed is still banned despite never being hot.

I know there's a lot wrong with Mormonism but this one really bothers me for some reason."
"When you can control what the members put into their bodies, how they interact with others, what they can and can't do with their own body, and make everything normal and natural a ""grievous sin"", you can sell salvation at a low low price of 10% of your annual income."
"It's just the inconsistency that bothers me. If they just banned all caffeine it would seem less arbitrary. The rule as enforced makes no sense. I know looking for logic in religion is a losing game, I just can't help it, and it bothers me that they accept it without question. Inconsistencies like that are what got me on the path to questioning the Catholicism I was raised with"

"The whole gitcards-as-payments thing. I don't care if you're a thousand years old, there's no reasonable way you've not seen one of the many, many news stories on how these work."
Sending a cashiers check that’s for too much money to pay for something/reserve something and then asking for $ to be sent back (the original check subsequently bounces a few days later). So coming on Craigslist/Facebook/next door and people keep falling for it
"It happens on Rover too, taking advantage of newcomers looking for a first gig."
"My wife fell for something like this before we were married. She got a new “job” and actually was being paid small amounts for weeks to build trust. Then, they sent a larger check and asked for some portion of it to be sent back. Game over."
"VPNs. While there are situations where they are useful, those reasons do not always match the reasons the marketing material suggest. They are not a magical security and privacy unicorn that saves you from every possible security threat."
"I use my VPN for ONE reason, with several uses following from that reason. I'm stationed in South Korea and I don't want the Korean version of Netflix. Also: Internet porn is illegal here. Thanks to my VPN, I never left the good old US of A!"
"That's a legitimate use of a VPN, even if it does skirt the edge of a few Terms of Service conditions. That's not my concern.

My issue with VPNs is they are sold as the be all and end all of internet security and privacy. If that's your sole reason for having one, you've been sold on an idea that's only marginally better than flushing your money down the toilet."
"I am an IT technician, I cringe every time I hear a youtuber do their sponsorship spot on VPNs for privacy.

Unless it is Mullvad I don't trust them."
"Tom Scott is honest about VPNs when sponsoring them. And AFAIK he caused a lot of VPN companies to start paying attention to what their employees do for marketing as well, so a lot of other YouTubers essentially followed Tom's lead."
Internet porn is illegal there? Good on them!
"There's only 3 reasons anyone should use a VPN: if you want to access services or websites that are unavailable in your country; torrenting in specific countries (if you don't know what that is then I guarantee you don't have to worry about this); or if you need to connect to a remote network (in this case your VPN would either be provided by the company you work at or you'd set up a VPN yourself on your own machine. Again, if you don't know what this means then you don't need to worry about this). VPNs don't provide any meaningful privacy, if anything they just make you less private because now the VPN company has all your data"
"Not to mention how the VPN still needs to point that data to a location,  which is still a physical location, with a physical device, with its own device ID and MAC address, and IP address,  *and* you can find this location online because some assholes went around the world and mapped out wireless signal identification data Google maps style almost everywhere in populated places. So you can right now go to that site (I'm not posting it here) and find your address and it'll have the IDs of every signal coming from your home. All your smart devices, anything with Bluetooth, any wifi signals, your router, and it'll have serial numbers and model numbers and everything. So if you haven't changed your router gui password, all you need is the model number and you can look up the default password and get into that router easily. Like VPNs are the final layer of protection, not the first or only layer. There is so much information passing from you to the whole world that unless you are a cyber security wizard or have only hardline connections that you are unplugged from constantly,  the chances that a VPN will protect you from someone seeking to do you damage are not that high."

Take this former smoker’s upvote!
I'm sorry but how are they a *scam*?
They are made to look cool and people say they take the edge off but it's only because it's addictive and once you are hooked you need more to get normal. The fact that they are still legal is grandfathered policy getting protected by lobbists
They do look cool though?
"Not really. They were cool in the way alcohol is when it was some thing you could only do as an adult that people could be cool while using. Nowadays most people see smokers and think they look degenerate, because if they are smoking then they are."

"The wealth is going to ""trickle down""."
"Yeah, it's almost like when people already have enough money that they can hoard money when given more they're able to hoard it.

Alternatively when people have no money and are given it they use it to purchase goods and services in the local economy, which then gets used more and more. Improve their lives in general which reduces strain on social programs, reduces crimes, and overall creates a happier populace."
I had to scroll down **way too far** to see this as an answer.
"Wait, I feel something trickling down! Oh, no, that's just piss again"

I haven't spoken to a single person that didn't think it was scripted or fixed in some way
"Pyramid Schemes. I know we call them ‘multi-level marketing’ now, but we really should go back to the old name. Makes it clearer what they are."
"Pretty much any text/SMS based scam that relies on recipient clicking on a link to 'validate' some account login or request.

Some of these scams are pretty hard to detect (like a business email compromise, where a threat actor slips into an existing email thread). But anything where someone from out of the blue just contacts you with no context, should be incredibly suspicious."
That billionaires care about helping the working class.
Trump
"Even on just the most basic, literal scam level. Look at the Trump University case, or how he is no longer legally permitted to run a charitable organization."
Doesn't he also have some company printing out ultra-expensive bibles?
"Not just that. 

He's also had people in positions of authority introduce legislation that *forces* schools to buy it (at $59.99 per copy):

https://bjconline.org/oklahomas-regulations-trump-endorsed-bible-for-public-schools-101524/

Your tax dollars at work. 

Screw education, schools need to line Trumps pockets instead."
Trump couldn't even get approved to drive for Doordash.
"It's amazing how many people there are who voted for him but wouldn't hire him, maintain his employment or fail to complain to management about his behavior and incompetency, if he wasn't Donald Trump. 

The guy couldn't pass a background check. His business and charitable organizations history would turn away any employer that would research such things. His demeanor would turn away any employer that actually gave him an interview, unless they were desperate for general labor. If you deposited him into a different body, the only thing he would be qualified to do is to be the basest stereotype of the Trump voter."
That was my first reaction when he pretended to work a shift at McDonald's. The guy is a convicted felon with pending felony cases to boot. He couldn't actually work at a McDonald's if he wanted to.
"If most people acted presidential at work, they would be shitcanned before lunch."
Or they’d be CEO by 5pm
Yeah I doubt they would let me serve nuggets wearing a tie.
As a convicted felon I believe he's not allowed to own a gun.
"I mean, plenty of fast food places hire felons.  When I worked at Wendy's, one of my co-workers was on probation for counterfeitting money & another had done credit card fraud...at another Wendy's.  They openly talked about that stuff.


Edit: Another 2 co-workers had armed robbery charges.  They were brothers & got the charges together."
"Most every job application asks about felony convictions background check or not. 

For about a year I worked with guy at a restaurant that doesn't do background checks. A co-worker saw him on the Megan's Law registry and he was fired the next day. They told him he lied on his application. 

I also know someone who was turned down for a job at Lowe's because of his credit score. How many bankruptcies does Trump have lol?"
"Yeah, but stuff like fast food will hire you anyways."
"Sounds like he's actually pretty qualified for middle management, tbh."
"but he's allowed to run our country.

he's trying to corrupt the populace gradually."
"His followers literally *died* for him on January 6th and he didn’t pardon *any* of them. He didn’t think that the lives of the people who would spend years in prison for him were worth the fucking effort of putting a pen to paper.

He thinks their lives are worthless, and he shows it *every fucking day* but his followers hate *us* for pointing out how terrible he is *to them.*

It’s especially frustrating because I have a lot of Trump supporters in my family who I love, and he’s convinced them that I hate them and think they’re idiots when *he* is the one who just sees them as useful idiots."
"It's so hard when it's people you love and you feel like ""I love you, but I don't trust you and don't feel safe around you"" because you know they prioritized a promise of money in their pocket over people's lives."
How could he have pardoned them?
"A federal pardon can be issued prior to the start of a legal case or inquiry. Nixon hadn’t even been charged with anything when Gerald Ford pardoned him. 

Pardons have been used by the president in presumptive cases before, and Trump was no stranger to pardoning people. He pardoned a *lot* of his friends while he was in office, and he had just as much authority to pardon everyone who stormed the Capitol on January 6th."
"But also he wasn’t president anymore, right?"
"He was president for a whole 2 weeks after January 6th.

January 6th is when Congress certifies the election results. The actual transfer of power doesn’t happen until January 20th.

He was *absolutely* still president."
There was no indication that they were going to pursue charges against these people or even knew who they were.  You wanted Trump to issue pardons for thousands of people or to chase down the few that would eventually have charges brought upon them?  I don't think he's hiding a time machine from us.
">there was no indication that they were going to pursue charges against the people that stormed the Capitol with the exclaimed goal of “hanging Mike Pence”

yeah just a totally normal afternoon lynching, nothing legally dubious here. Not like there are any [laws prohibiting the obstruction of Congress](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1725-protection-government-processes-obstruction-pending-proceeding-18) or anything like that, no sir."
"My bad. But, pardons typically take months, sometimes years. I can’t imagine anyone on his team would’ve thought it would be a good idea to rush through pardons on the way out when they were likely already hoping for another term in the future."
"It can take that long to *apply* for a pardon.

Once a presidential pardon is granted, it typically takes effect immediately. In some cases, there might be a delay in the official documentation and notification process, but this delay is usually brief and doesn’t affect the legal status of the pardon."
">Pardons typically take months, sometimes years.

When the accused is requesting them and then has to convince the governor/president to issue one.

But a governor or president only has to sign a piece of paper to actually issue a pardon.  Takes about 5 minutes for a staffer to write it up, a second or two to sign."
"He really wanted to pardon them, but then they looked too ""low class"" and he didn't want to be associated with them."
"“I left you to rot in prison for years just to protect my image” 

Ah, so he was using them, and promptly discarded them the second they were of no use to him. They had fulfilled a deed for him, but the second they became a slight liability, he left them to rot in prison.

Got it. Great leader."
How could Trump pardon people that were convicted and imprisoned after he left office?
Presumptive pardons are possible.  See: Nixon.
"Two political promises offering something valuable for free to get votes.

- 2016: build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. 

- 2024: US tariffs on Chinese products. Chinese payment on the tariffs will pay off the national debt"
"And both of those things Americans are ultimately paying for... he used US military funds to build his wall prototypes, and the costs of tariffs will be pushed onto the consumer."
Yep. Scam.
"The benefit is nobody really has to think when they vote... Until  it affects them.


I don't nnned vaccines because I haven't ssen polio... Oh shit. Here's polio"
"I think the point is; even when it affects them, they won't change. They have someone else to blame, and that is more attractive than being responsible for your own actions."
"People wanted to stick it to the ""coastal elites"" by voting for a New York city billionaire."
Got problems in life? Have you considered blaming The Others?
"I don't know what people see in that guy. I honestly wouldnt trust that guy to run a gas station, much less a country."
There is no small portion of people that will believe *anything* if you say it with a straight enough face or out-and-out confidence.
"LOL their recruiting video says they won't hire convicted felons, tax evaders, or people who filed for bankruptcy."
"I mean, the future president is selling crypto personally so foreign assets can just buy his fake asset and funnel money legally from all sorts of shady foreign assets. He wouldn’t pass a background check at Walmart."
I was wondering when I'd find this. Way too far down.
This should have been the top answer
The obvious answer.
I love how the people responding do you don't get your point. These people are gone.
"The entire GOP, honestly."
"You Neglected To Mention His Dope Smoking Buddy, Elon...."
TDS
"TDSS, or ''Trump derangement syndrome syndrome''. The syndrome where you can only respond ''TDS'' everytime someone's attack the dear leader for some stupid, dangerous or illegal shit he did."
"For anyone reading - this kind of thing is called a thought-terminating cliche, and it's a really obvious hallmark of cults. The whole point is that they post it as a way to shut down any arguments they don't like, so they don't have to think about it."
"You guys see ""Trump"" and have your thoughts terminated."
"""No you"" is not an intelligent comeback."
Am I wrong?
"Yeah, you are."
"Not really, no."
"Is this supposed to be enlightening? All you've done is come in, say ""no you"", declared yourself correct, and added nothing of value to the thread. You couldn't have been a better example of my point if you were doing it on purpose."
"Dude there's very little to be said to a person who doesn't second-guess why people voted for a different party than his own.

What do you want me to say?"
This is by far the dumbest reply I've received on Reddit in the last couple of years. Yet you applaud it when someone claims Trump X or Y when it's obviously a lie to the point where you make up TDSS. Show everyone on the doll where Trump hurt you. This is a safe space.
"You posting this proves the point lmao. Such a sheep - never had an original thought in your life, so you parrot the same old shit."
"Haha, the trump comment was so original and your response proves my point. You do know there's drugs for TDS. Careful you might spill that DemoRat Kool aid on you and then everyone will see your political ideology that controls your every thought."
I hate him with an undying passion.
We know
You ever wonder if the hate is justified?
Nah.
Could really help you out a bit.
"Mate you can't even understand why people are Republican, you need to do the introspection here."
"I can absolutely understand why people are republican lol. 

Being maga is a whole different story. But even then. I know why people support him."
Give me a reason then.
"Because they have been convinced that Republicans will help the economy. Historically this isn't true. 

Also because of religious affiliation and issues related to that. Abortion. LGBTQ rights. That kind of stuff. 

Also because people have been convinced that liberalism is something it isn't."
Yeah this really isn't what the average voter thinks.
"I addressed multiple reasons, and they are absolutely what the average Trump voter thinks.

It is objectively true that Trump lies about ""his"" economy. It's objectively true that democrats run the economy better. Even TRUMP has said so.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRndMiVIB-w

Religious affiliation and anti-abortion, anti gay opinions are objectively intertwined. You're only lying to yourself by denying this fact. 

It's also objectively true that liberalism has been demonized by Trump and the right wing, despite the fact that it's one of the most important aspects of Democracy. (which is also now demonized by Trump and the right wing)

I'll respond to you again if you're able to actually say something of value. But another half ass answer with zero substance won't get another response. You asked me to give you a reason and I did. You denied it and refused to add anything to the conversation lol."
I'm gonna have to type a lot first. And go to sleep before that. I'll continue it in the morning.
What's the difference between maga and Republicans
Maga is a fascist cult. Republicans are not.
Then what is antifa
Several different groups of people who identify as anti-fascist.... lol
So the people who identify as anti-fascist or the ones that go out and try to shut down people trying to have open conversations. And they bring in more people when they really don't like the person who's speaking. I'm not really sure that you guys understand what the definition of fascist is. Because if you're going out there and trying to prevent someone from talking that makes you the fascist and so far I have yet to see a left-wing Democrat on a speaking tour getting shouted at or having to have police escorts to the building and outside the building because there were people trying to shut down their talk other than the recent Nancy pelosi interview.
I don’t think any hate is justified
No person ever deserves hate? Not even Hitler?
Nope.
"Well, I know YOU don't hate Hitler."
"Yeah, I hate what Hitler did."
Right I'm sure the 88 in your username was just randomly generated.
It was the year I was born…
No person ever deserves hate? Not even Hitler?
"That’s up to you. Hate is not a thing, it’s a feeling YOU control. Which is why I said “I think”. I choose not to participate in hate, the world has enough of it."
I disagree entirely.
"You disagree with what? That hate is not a thing? There’s too much hate in the world? You control the hate you feel? 

I guess it doesn’t matter… here’s a good example of what over half the country can see in you and the rest of your party. I’m saying there’s too much hate in the world and you’re disagreeing with it. I’ll choose love and you can choose hate, I’ll still choose to love you"
"That hate isn't a thing and that certain people don't deserve it. 

I didn't disagree that there is too much hate. There absolutely is. That doesn't mean you can't hate hateful people."
"Yo everybody replying to this comment: what do you guys get out of this? You type up an insulting comment or some terrible accusation (for the millionth time), score a few upvotes, and when you get notifications from this thread you know what it’s going to be before you click it: it’s justcmore of the same insults and accusations you’ve been reading and writing for eight (8) years now.  I’m not trying to troll I’m asking in good faith: why do you bother? What do you get out of doing this same song and dance? There’s no nuance, nothing being analyzed or critiques, there’s no point. Am I missing something? It seems like it’s some form of prayer at this point"
"They're not insults, they're literal facts. Yeah maybe people are exhausted and frustrated that a fucking felon who instigated an attempted insurrection is going to be the president again and need to vent. It's really not that hard to understand."

"Trump is a scam. He ran on making the economy better, it was doing well for a post pandemic economy. He ran on immigration change, but cancelled a bill with bipartisan support that would put 2,500 officers on the border. If you think stuffing the regulated government agencies with literally the people they are meant to oppose we are living on the irony timeline in the multiverse. lol."
"Open our minds to... supporting the Proud Boys? Further destroying quality of life via thoughtless tariffs?

"I’m not American but fuck me are we both laughing and crying with how fucked your country is about to get.

Sure, we might be wrong and nothing may change.

"You mean the 90% chance? It'd be a shock if Trump didn't royally fuck the US, and most of the world to some degree

You mean how Biden fucked us. And why didn't Trump do it the first time
"Lol god, you've got your head so deep in the sand. If you think Biden was bad for your country, you're completely lost. In every metric, he did really well for you.

And Trump did SOME of it the first term, and cost millions of lives, but it makes time to unethical stack every department of government with incompetent slack-jaw lackeys. Now that his groundwork is laid, and he's bringing in the final touches of incompetent yes-men with his cabinet picks, he has unfettered control in completing the destruction he started last time."
My 401K tripled under Biden
"How did that pull out of Afghanistan go? Bush Russian invasion, Obama Russian invasion, Biden Russian invasion, Trump no invasion 🤔

How many billions have been spent on Ukraine. 

Remember when you were told hunter's laptop was disinformation?

And when his daughter's diary came out where she said she probably shouldn't have taken showers with her dad when she was a teenager. 

Or the fact Biden doesn't recognize Hunter's daughter because she was a stripper. 

Shall I continue?"
"There's so much nonsense in this comment. You're borderline delusional. But it tells me there's no point in refuting any of it, because you don't base your opinion on reality. And I won't be able to use logic to argue someone out of a position logic didn't get them in to in the first place."
"The old I can't respond to you because you don't lack knowledge or I can't logically respond. That right there in itself is hilarious because I used fax that anyone with basic computer knowledge could Google and see that the items I listed are 100% true but however since you're so smarter than everybody else and there's no way that you could actually carry on a conversation and be civilized without your Trump arrangement syndrome kicking in I'll go ahead and let some other people talk. And before you respond let me first explain to you that what these questions are showing in this video are in fact true and have been injured into record in this hearing. So if they are false then there could not be a way for them to be entered into record. But go ahead and tell everyone again how smart you are by not responding and to each one of my points.

Everyone is now dumb after reading your reply.  I get it I get it You're not that good at computers and you don't know how to use Google and prove me wrong. Someone with an ounce of intellectualism would have sat there and read it and said you know what I'm going to prove this guy wrong and I'm going to take his facts and I'm going to turn around and show him where he's wrong. Yet you can't because you know I'm right
"No one ever denied the fact that Putin invaded when he did. The fact that he didn't invade under Trumps 4 years is completely irrelevant. We knew Russia was planning to invade during Trumps presidency...which is why we were sending aid under Trumps administration lmfao.

Lmfao."
Tell me you don't know how economies work without telling me you don't know how economies work.

If Trump's economic policies were so bad, why did Biden keep them in place and why did Kamala use some of his ideas on her campaign."
Nah... we're fucked.
"Sure. Open my mind.

He's a convicted felon.

He has made a fortune by taking advantage of bankruptcy laws in the U.S. over and over. Not illegal, but very shady business practices.

He lost a civil to a woman he sexually harassed.

He was convicted of a felony for falsifying business records to cover up a hush-money payment.

He was being prosecuted for obstructing congress (Jan 6).

He politicized the justice department when he was president (this is debatable, of course).

He traded pardons for loyalty commitments from convicted felons. This is well documented.

He withheld $400M congress had allocated for Ukraine.

He has profited from his presidency, which is a direct conflict of interest and highly unethical.

But please do tell me where and how I need to be open minded. Are you open to believing what I wrote above? I'm pretty sure I'm an objective person who looks to facts and evidence to make judgements. Do you?"
"He didn't harass E Jean Carol, he raped her. Ar least that's what the judge in that case said when it was over."
"Fair enough. I was not trying to minimize what happened. I was trying to be less provocative for somebody who obviously is either not well informed or is in denial. I kind of soft-sold the the list, and omitted a bunch of stuff as well. 

I'm doing my best to try and bring people along without shaming, insulting, or being offensive. It doesn't seem to be working, but I try."
I commend and condone your efforts.
But gas prices were super low while he was president!
"One of my cousins told me that ""egg prices were better when he was president."" I asked if she literally voted for the president because of the price of eggs. She did not answer. 

Btw, almost every economic indicator is better under Biden vs. Trump.

[removed]
You say that like that means he isn’t a scam lol? He’s a grifter / a scammer  — it’s all he’s ever known how to do and he’s clearly scammed the majority of the American populace.
The people who voted for him in 2016 felt so cheated that they voted for him a second & third time.
"Again, the prompt is...

> What's a scam that you're surprised people still fall for?

You are just reinforcing the answer by pointing out people voted for him multiple times."
Exhibit A
Exactly - people are still falling for his scam
By a lot. Like the whole country except liberal cities that did not require voter ID.
Which just proves how many people are falling for the scam.
You know maybe people just like Trump more than Dems.
"Clearly many do - but that doesn't mean he isn't a scammer, it just shows how successful his scam is."
Or maybe he's not a scammer?
Yeah - he's definitely a scammer.
Yes. *Everyone else* is wrong.

There was a guy in a store parking lot claiming to be a veteran and needing gas money.  I politely declined but sat on a nearby bench.  Someone else handed him $20 and guess what.....he did the same with a few others.  Whether a veteran or not (hunch is he wasn't) he was scamming people and using a lie to basically panhandle.
"being green. 

top 10 corporations produce 90% of the pollution. but it always falls on the citizen to be green! buy an ev you can’t afford!! 

if everyone is pissing in the pool besides you, are you making a difference?

and i don’t mean to litter freely, everyone should 110% do their part. BUT. it’s crazy to think/ask citizens to completely change their routine day to day life while you still move on private jets/ motorcades.


for those of you jay don’t know. i drive a diesel F250. a new one with modern emission systems. every 5k ish miles i have to buy DEF(Diesel exhaust fluid) for my emissions right?

it comes in a 2.5 gallon plastic jug. with a plastic nosel thats wrapped in plastic in a cardboard box.. so how fucking much am i helping?… (this is a required chemical on all diesels 2011? 2010? and newer"
"DEF is honestly pretty magical stuff. It's there to turn NOx (nitric oxide and nitric dioxide) gasses into nitrogen and water, as well as VOCs into 

Without it, NOx combines with oxygen and hydrogen in the atmosphere to create nitric acid -> this is the formation of acid rain. NOx is a major contributor to lung cancer and smog - the shit's nasty!

The environmental effects of the DEF container are negligible, compared to the benefits of DEF. 

Cool tip, as well - many trucking fuel stations have DEF on the nozzle. It's a lot cheaper than buying it in the jug."
"yeah i’ve found a station or 2 like that, just sucks i don’t have any close to me with it, the closest one is in a random part of town off the highway probably 20-30min away so it’s pretty inconvenient sadly"
"Every drop that it is not pissed makes water quality a bit better, but you are right, as long as big corporations and countries don't see the need to be green, it is impossible to suceed"

"If you compare the CO2 Emission per capita, the US polutes 13.3 t in 2023. In comparison, China ""only"" polutes 8.9 t per capita. Therefore, it would make a change, if the US would polute less. If you take the EU as a similarly developed environment with similar needs as the US, numbers are looking even worse: 5.4 t per capita in the EU Vs. 13.3 t per capita in the US. 
If the US would take similar measures as EU (more renewable energy, more EVs, less plastic, better public transportation, better recycling), it would make a significant change.

Here is the source to these numbers:
[IEA Emission per Capita overview](https://www.iea.org/reports/co2-emissions-in-2023/the-changing-landscape-of-global-emissions)"
"This is interesting information, thank you."
"And that’s the issue. Per capita calculations are missing the wide distribution of emissions based on income of individuals and the corporations that are creating it. The US has the most millionaires by a lot, I think we can understand how they produce more pollution and overconsumption than an individual with average income. Manufacturing and shipping cause much of the pollution as well, so by calculating per capita, all you’re doing is diluting by population size and effectively ignoring who is actually producing the bulk of it, whose changes would actually make an impact. 

When speaking of policy, it really doesn’t matter what the per capita is anyway. If China created a policy that would cut manufacturing emissions by 30%, that would equal a greater impact on co2 emissions than if the U.S. did. Again, per capita calculations isn’t really the right metric for this issue."
"In my opinion, it is hard to find a good measure to compare countries overall. If you know about a better one, please let me know, as I am curious to learn about it.
For the emissions from wealthy people and poor people you are right, rich people polute more then poor people. 
If you go away form comparing China to the US and instead compare EU and US, it might be easier to use the per capita metric (similar age structure of population, similar industry, similar distribution of wealth). Therefore, the US definitely also has potential to become more environmentally friendly overall. And as indicated above: every action makes a difference."
"The device you're using to read this comment was probably manufactured in China.

They emitted plenty of CO2 mining all the materials, shipping them to factories, running the manufacturing machines, shipping the manufactured parts from the glass factory and the battery factory to the phone factory, and then shipping the product to you.

You can't just blame them for this. It is *our consumption* that is responsible for these emissions.

The United States has by far the highest consumption per capita of any country"
"CO2 emissions are not the same as dumping chemicals in the ground.

One is plant food, and the others are poisons."

The benefit of EV is also highly dependent on where you live. Both in terms of convenience and how green it really is. It's always greener than ICE vehicles but in some places not by as much as you'd hope
Yeah. Coal electricity powered EVs are less green than ICE cars.
I don't know if that's completely true. EVs have a higher carbon footprint at the beginning but are way more efficient with the fuel they get. Coal powerplants are also incredibly efficient at turning coal into energy. It'd just take a long time for the break even point vs an ICE vehicle. However I don't know the numbers so I could be wrong
"Just like they keep pushing people in the US saying we need to do more. What they aren't saying is no matter what we do, if the countries that are doing 99% of the actual polluting don't stop, nothing more we do here is going to make a difference at this point."
"> the countries that are doing 99% of the actual polluting don't stop

The countries doing the actual polluting are doing so to manufacture things for consumers in other countries. 

The device you're using to read this comment was probably manufactured in China, and plenty of CO2 was emitting in mining all the materials, shipping them to factories, running the manufacturing machines, shipping the manufactured parts from the glass factory and the battery factory to the phone factory, and then shipping the product to you.

In the statistics, all of these emissions are bucketed under China, but it's YOUR consumer behavior that's responsible for them

On a global scale, Western countries are responsible for the vast majority of emissions, they just offload them elsewhere.

If you want less emissions from manufacturing laptops/phones, consumers need to buy less laptops and phones"

Or that we are very good at having cheap Chinese and Indian workers make products for us. Like how many of our products are (partly) manufactured in India, Bangladesh or China?

"Do you think those companies who produce all the pollution are doing it because they enjoy heating up the earth? No, they do it because they're producing products that we as consumers use. Most of CO2 emissions come from transportation, agriculture and power consumption. The idea that it's the corporations fault is just a way to absolve ourselves from confronting the fact that our modern lifestyle is extremely CO2 intensive."
">Do you think those companies who produce all the pollution are doing it because they enjoy heating up the earth?

No, they're doing it because they don't give a shit that they're heating up the earth. They also don't do it because we use the products. They do it because we buy the products. They could find ways to produce the products without producing massive amounts of CO2, but then they wouldn't make as much money on the products.

They don't produce the products because we consume them; we consume the products because they produce them. Demand is manufactured by those same corporations."

Tbh I bought an EV because it was worth it to me in the end by its looks and gas saving money and it takes $5 a month on my bill to charge my car the whole month and since I walk to work that’s why it’s $5 lol.

"You are 100% right that companies shift the blame onto consumers with BS “green” package and shit. But yes, you actually are doing something. Climate change is a verrry intricate issue and is not just about global warming.

But there are so many things that play into it that doing what you can really does have an affect. Biodiversity is a huge issue that gets massively overshadowed.

It’s easy to doom spiral and think but if you calculate your carbon footprint, you’ll realize just how much you’re putting out there. (there’s a website called footprint calculator that makes it easy)

So no, you can’t stop the overwhelmingly biggest players in the environment. But a collective “it’s out of my hands” mentality doesn’t help either. Doing what you can on a local level has an impact"

Dumpsters of food are thrown out by grocery stores constantly. And they chain it up so homeless people can dumpster dive. All because of ""best by"" dates that manufacturing companies arbitrarily set with no oversight that don't mean food has reached its expiry. More tossed food means more money.

They focus should be on keeping the car on the road for as long as possible, so replacement batteries should be affordable, the components should be modular so they are easy to replace and everything should be upgradeable.   
Of course there is no economic reason why anybody would want to do this so.."

"Crytpo. It's pretty much all speculative. I've followed the technology since 2012 and even got on board. This was back when MTGoX was the only way you could get bitcoin. 

Originally, I liked the concept of being in charge of your own wealth without having to use a bank. There were of course huge barriers for that to happen. The biggest one, at least back in the day, was the time it took for the block chain to converge changes. It made things like using bitcoin in common places unreasonable. For example, back in the day you couldn't really pay for your groceries with bitcoin unless the receiver took a huge gamble that the exchange would clear because it would take 5-20 minutes to finish the block chain. Imagine scanning your groceries and then having to hang out in the store for like 30 minutes until the grocer said, ""Okay, your transaction cleared! Here's your receipt!""

In 2012, I was on board with it because I figured that eventually we would figure out how to overcome technical limitations to make the concepts that made crypto attractive to me, a reality. Unfortunately, that never really developed and now people mostly just use Bitcoin and analogs as currency speculation. While a few more places accept crypto as a legit form of payment, I feel like the vast majority of uses in the past 5 years have mostly revolved around rug pull/pump and dump schemes which is sad because I still like the premises that I originally liked in 2012.

I pulled out my original investment on the first wave when Bitcoin popped off, but I will probably never participate again. I know there are some crypto bros that will probably counter some of my thoughts on this but it doesn't matter. I feel like crypto has hurt far more people than it's helped and it's honestly just become yet another shelter for the wealthy to avoid taxes and increase wealth by taking advantage of poorer people looking for financial stability in a financially unstable world."

"I think you're generalising here, many people have profited (me included) off crypto like Bitcoin, some have obviously lost too. However for some, it is a long term investment, similar to something like S&P500. S&P500 obviously has more history and could well be a safer investment but people usually have crypto as a part of a diversified portfolio. 


I would never recommend anyone invest more in to crypto than they are willing to lose, but that's the same as with any investment. "
"I agree it's a scam, but you are taking such a black and white approach. I've made a lot of money investing in crypto over the last 10 years or so. I think the concept of crypto is idiotic, at least at this stage. You can't use Bitcoin as a currency if the value is going to be so insanely volatile. That said, you can absolutely make a stupid amount of money investing in crypto. 


Investing in crypto is pretty much like gambling though. I put a small amount of money (like $1k) in Bitcoin 10+ years ago. I was fully aware that it could go to zero at any moment, so I only put in money that I could afford to lose. That $1k probably would have turned into like a million damn dollars if I would have just held onto the Bitcoin I bought back then. You'd be pretty crazy to hold that long when the investment is going up thousands of percent though (particularly on something as fundamentally dumb as Bitcoin). It's important to be logical about your investment decisions, even if that doesn't necessarily lead to the best result. Technically looking back I should have cashed out my 401k and invested everything in Bitcoin and I'd be a billionaire! But Jesus Christ that would have been idiotic without the knowledge of hindsight.


Anyways, basically every year or two I sell and make several thousand of profit. Whenever the crypto market skyrockets I start dollar cost average selling. Even with taking all that profit I still have quite a bit invested, still just as gambling money as I know it could (and likely will) crash at any moment. Every few years I might invest a small amount more when the market really crashes.


All that to say that I agree it's a scam, but a scam in the way any gambling is a scam (lottery, casinos, sports betting, etc). You can make money on those things, but you've got to understand there is a very real chance (or even high probability) that you will lose everything. Hell, even the stock market is a scam to a degree. Especially with stocks like GameStop, but also with stocks like Tesla where the value is exponentially inflated. There's zero logical reason Tesla should have that level of market cap, so I think owning that stock is almost as much a ""scam"" as owning Bitcoin. It doesn't meeting people haven't made an absurd amount of money investing in Bitcoin and Tesla though."

It’s a sign of being a deeply fucked and shitty human being."
 It's not about becoming rich to buy a lambo and brag that you're rich.  it's about using money to make more money to retire and actually enjoy life. A lot of jobs today do not have pensions.

Just in the last couple weeks I've made like $10k of gains because of the ridiculous market. I make sure to dollar cost average out of crypto when it's skyrocketing like this because I know it will likely crash at some point soon like it always does. 


I absolutely do not trust crypto as a long term investment, so I take the profits and put them in index funds. When it crashes I typically invest a little more. It's a ridiculous cycle of profit..."
So you purchase your goods and services with stock shares?
"Off the bat, crypto is garbage.

But this is not what the word 'scam' is. Cryptocurrency is not a scam. It's a highly speculative investment (let's call it gambling) which you can indeed buy some things with. I'm not sure why you would with such an incredibly volatile currency, but you can.

There is a form of democracy which results in truly representative legislature, is completely fair, and is immune to corruption. [Sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition) was fundamental to democracy in Ancient Athens, often called the birthplace of democracy. They would likely look at modern democracy and think it abhorrent. 

There are modern organisations like the Sortition Foundation which advocate for increasing use of sortition, and perhaps even as a replacement for elections altogether."

So the majority of the Americans that voted are in a cult?
yes
This is an insane way of thinking. So glad I'm not American. Neither side can tell their ass from their face.
"If you were American you'd see what were talking about when we call it a cult. 

Never in my life have I seen old conservative men worship ANYONE to the extent that they worship Trump. Not even Jesus. They've compared them on several occasions, though. That's how deep this cult goes. 

I can't even drive to work without passing several Trump flags. Doesn't matter how close the election is. They fly them permanently and replace them with new ones as they wear out. They completely cover their vehicles in flags, stickers and even put small billboards on top, ALL for the sole purpose of signaling their support of their cult leader."

"Going to university. 

Not a total scam, but way overpriced for what it is.  While tuition has skyrocketed, all the money has gone to more administrative jobs. Very little to the actual education of students."
Unfortunately many professional legally require a specific type of university degree. Education for the rich who can afford it or indebted bondage for life if you’re unlucky
"Even in the professional careers, which I appreciate the necessity for the advanced degree, has been perverted. 

I had to take “early jazz” to get a degree in mechanical engineering.  In today’s dollars, that one course probably cost me $3k of wasted time.   There is the 1/2 of the scam."
"You didn't have to take early jazz, you had to take one elective course in the arts or humanities from a list with a wide variety of courses to choose from and for whatever reason you picked one you thought was foolish and a waste of time."
"I remember the options were between early jazz, something in pottery, an art appreciation course, or something else in classical music. The elective had to be in one of the arts.

Which really pissed me off even more because I was already a well established percussionist, with a scholarship offer from an esteemed university. I did not take that scholarship because that particular university did not offer an engineering program."

Those “you may be entitled to…” law ads. Depending on what scandal happens publicly there were be like 10 law firms foaming at the mouth trying to get clients
This isn't a scam.  Tinder a few years back had a class action against it for charging men more money for premium.  I had premium for about 6 months back then which ran about $120 dollars.  Fast forward 5 months later.  I got settlement of 3 grand from that class action.
"Yeah, *occasionally* they're legit. I got money from one recently (I think LendUp?), and the check was 100% real/cleared. It was around $150, iirc."
"Yes! They are required to provide information on the lawsuit,.which you can then use to look up in the court docket to see if they're legit. If you do your due diligence, you can get legit payments. I've made a few grand on these (most are small potatoes, but I qualified for a couple big ones in the last recession). "
No but like the ads that makes people think a company or person has a major suit against them but it turns out to be nothing
"You do understand that to file a class action you have to have a class of plaintiffs to represent.  That's what those ads are for.  To gather the plaintiffs.  If there are not enough plaintiffs the suit either doesn't get filed or in other cases the suite runs into blocks.   
Those ads never ask for money or payment.   So I don't really see how you could call it a scam"
No but the type where they try to get a class action going like what happened to dkoldies
"If that's the game company that was accused of price gouging, then that's literally a legitimate case for a class action.

Also are you sure you understand what a scam is?"
Yes but even when there’s a legitimate argument to sue often law firms will try to market it as if a major suit is starting or about to start
"Yeah so they can get plaintiffs.  That doesn't make it a scam.A scam is the intentional use of deceit, a trick or some dishonest means to deprive another of his/her/its money, property or a legal right.  

Those law firms don't take cash from you or request a retainer, they take their legal feels from the company being sued.  

It's not a scam 🤦"

"I work in customer service for one of the main banks in the UK, and the amount of customers we get that are falling impersonation scams is unreal. These scammers are mainly impersonating us, calling customers and telling them that there's been fraudulent transactions on their account, and that they need to transfer their funds out to a safe account created in their name.

There's a system in the UK called 3D secure - its an approval method that requires you to manually approve any online transactions in your banking app before the payment is made, and it's a system that's required by law to mitigate these types of fraudulent payments.

These scammers will make online transactions for thousands and tell people to approve this in their app to transfer it over to a safer account. Couple this with a 'verification text' from a spoofed number and people will fall for it hook line and sinker 99% of the time.

Just remember if the bank calls you asking you to move funds anywhere, its not the bank and you should hang up straight away.

EDIT: Romance scams are also insanely common, and sometimes some of the saddest calls we take in CS.

These are when someone has been speaking to an individual online, usually for a number of years, and has grown an attachment or a relationship with this person, who has manipulated them into transferring their money over to them for family emergencies or hospital bills - quite often losing their life savings."

"Medicare Advantage. For real. Medicare is the best insurance I ever had. Advantage is just regular insurance companies taking the money you paid in during your work years as monthly payment to provide the normal very flawed insurance we in the U.S. are used to, which is to say they try their best not to pay if they can get away with it. I know insurance quite well having been disabled since age 5. I worked 40 years but am now retired. 

Even with ACA protections in place insurers try to keep from paying for services your doctor prescribes. Right now I have a pressure sore on my foot. My home health nursing supervisor who certifies my need each month told me recently if I had Advantage she would not be able to get service for me now that it's doing much better, regardless of the fact that the doctor and the nurses treating me say I still require treatment. In the past I've had sores reopen or become infected if treatment ends too soon.

Also when my dad was dying he had Medicare Advantage - because they hard sell with telemarketers using cold calls constantly and he was very vulnerable to that kind of tactic. (I got 3 calls Saturday.) He had terrible bed sores. But could not get home health for them through the Advantage program he was enrolled in. Fortunately he got some care through the VA. We private paid the rest. At the same time I had smaller better managed sores and was able to get Medicare coverage.

Before y'all without the experience jump in with your feelings about how people should not have terrible bed sores if they're being cared for properly: if you have poor circulation and are bedbound or can't move your lower extremities well you can get skin breakdown within a matter of hours even when you're actively trying not to. They will get worse without help. It is a constant battle, even with proper booties and mattress covers and turning and all the other methods of mitigating. Once it is an open sore it needs care and constant dressing changes to keep from becoming a serious problem. 

My sister was executor of my dad's estate because she's the eldest. It took nearly two years of constant battle to get Advantage to reimburse for his last month of care. And my sister is a formidable opponent in phone battles and paperwork wars. I have never once had to fight to get Medicare to pay for services that had already been approved and provided. Sometimes you need to wait a period of time to replace medical equipment but that is something you discuss during the approval process. Once approved it is promptly paid. And equipment replacement periods are quite reasonable.

Medicare Advantage is a straight up scam. And the ads you see telling old people ""you may be eligible for"" all kinds of outlandish extras are Advantage ads meant to draw you in. They bear no resemblance to actual coverage except under very extreme situations that most people never find themselves in. Like all U.S. health insurance it is great as hypothetical aid sometime in the future when you might be ill for a brief period of time. If you actually need that help they will find a reason you don't qualify or just flat out stall 2 years so you go on and die.

Finally, if you take an Advantage plan when you first qualify for Medicare while you are still healthy and it is all hypothetical, then you discover later it doesn't cover what you need you forever pay more for Medicare. And yes Medicare is insurance and you do pay for it monthly. It is just better less costly insurance because they are allowed to bargain down fee schedules."
Fox News
Multilevel marketing pyramid schemes
"Political parties.

The number of people trying to form “the resistance” or bitching about trump 24/7 is laughable.  The Democrats wouldn’t piss on you if you were on fire.

That’s somewhat matched with the crowd looking for retribution or spiking the ball thinking that voters gave trump a mandate for everything.  They didn’t.

The fact is that elections get won in the middle by people that don’t pay attention or support anything that any candidate says.  They’re usually referendums on how good/bad the people in charge are doing.  Just because people overwhelmingly thought that Biden did shitty doesn’t mean we going full project 2025.

The other fact is that no politician gives a fuck about you (no, really, they don’t give a shit).  To them, you’re something they have to endure, to put up with, to suffer through.  They need you to go out and vote once an election cycle and they bullshit you the rest of the time.  

The result is people like you and I fighting with each other, them remaining in office where they enrich themselves and try to get grift jobs and careers for their friends and family.

Sometimes they pretend to be the person in danger, sometimes they say they are the kidnapper and bad things will happen if they don't get the money. I had one recently where a woman was told her daughter was caught with drugs in her car, and had her infant with her. The woman immediately went to gather the money. The daughter and baby were safe at home. The family couldn't reach the woman for hours.  The family believed she was dead there for a while. This whole family was terrified and traumatized, and lost a large chunk of their life savings that day.  

We really need PSAs regarding scams that use such emotional manipulation. It's not just old people falling for this stuff."

It's an obvious scam because 1.) You'd remember going onto the website and signing up. 2.) PCH doesn't call people. 3.) If you won a prize (that you signed up for) PCH sends you a letter by certified delivery (the one you have to sign for). And 4.) They send news of the biggest prizes with the Prize Patrol, who are kinda iconic at this point and we'd recognize because of the huge poster board check, the balloons, and the camera crew that follows them."

Gift cards are a scam because they don’t have to sell you a good product to get your money. Someone buys a random gift card for someone else who probably would never have gone to that particular store anyway and that’s it. They’re not the worst scam but it’s still pretty slick when you think about it.

Because the book was written by men and translated four times, before you got to read it.  
In which case, it could easily have said ""Women are to be the dominant gender"" but men translated it to ""men are to be the dominant gender"" (Thinking more other religions outside of the bible, here. 

The fact is, we were never there. History has shown us (and there is proof of it) that man kind fabricates history / events, to hide the true story/event.

On top of this, the bible is interpreted differently by each individual who reads it, or each Church that may 'present' it differently. For example, one sect of Christianity / Church may now have issues with certain life styles, whereas others see that same lifestyle as an utter sin. 

Edit : ""Life Style"" can be interpreted to whatever you want it to mean..... Just like the bible.

Dont get me wrong though, I have no hate for the bible or religion. If you choose to follow that path, I will not try to persuade you otherwise. I just have issues with people convincing themselves that God has spoken too them and that this is a reason they are causing harm to others."

Nope. Trump is a rapist. He should be in jail.
Proof? Every time I ask for proof no one can produce it. They just keep saying he raped people but can't prove it.
"Dozens of women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct dating back to the 1970s, and he has been found liable in court for sexual abuse. Several women have described Trump forcibly reaching under their skirts, others said he kissed them without consent, and a handful of beauty pageant contestants claimed Trump inappropriately walked in on them in changing rooms. In total, about two dozen women have spoken out publicly to accuse Trump:

Jessica Leeds told The New York Times in 2016 that, in the late 1970s, Trump, who was a stranger to her, reached his hand up her skirt and grabbed her breasts on a flight to New York. She said he “was like an octopus” and his “hands were everywhere” before she fled to the back of the plane. 

Ivana Trump, Trump’s first wife, accused him in a divorce deposition of raping her in a fit of rage in 1989, when they were married. She later said that she hadn’t meant in a “literal or criminal sense.” 

Kristin Anderson, a photographer and former model, told The Washington Post in 2016 that Trump sat next to her at a nightclub in the early 1990s and reached under her skirt. Anderson said the incident lasted about 30 seconds, but she and her friends were “very grossed out and weirded out.” 

Two weeks before the 2024 election, Stacey Williams told the Guardian that she met Trump in 1992 through Jeffrey Epstein, who later became a registered sex offender, was charged with sex trafficking and died by suicide in 2019. Epstein suggested the two visit Trump in Trump Tower in New York in 1993, Williams said, and shortly after they arrived, Trump groped her breasts and her butt. The Trump campaign denied the allegation.

Jill Harth, who worked with Trump in the 1990s, accused him of “attempted rape” in a 1997 complaint. She said that in 1993, Trump tried to kiss her in his daughter’s bedroom at his Mar-a-Lago resort, pushing her against a wall and putting his hand up her dress. She dropped the suit a few weeks after filing it, she said as part of a settlement with Trump in a separate breach of contract case, according to the Associated Press.

Lisa Boyne, a health food business entrepreneur, told HuffPost in 2016 that she attended a dinner with Trump in 1996 where several women were forced to walk across a table while Trump looked up their skirts and commented on their underwear and bodies. “It was the most offensive scene I’ve ever been a part of,” Boyne said. 

Five former Miss Teen USA contestants told BuzzFeed News in 2016 that in 1997, Trump, the owner of the pageant at the time, unexpectedly walked into the contestants’ dressing room while they were changing, which they found inappropriate. Mariah Billado said she rushed to put on her dress and remembered him saying, “Don’t worry ladies, I’ve seen it all before.” Victoria Hughes said that it was “the most inappropriate time to meet us all for the first time. The youngest girl was 15, and I was the eldest at 19.” The other three women described a similar situation to BuzzFeed anonymously; however, 11 others said they did not recall seeing Trump in the dressing room at all. 

In an April 2005 interview on The Howard Stern Show, when asked about Miss USA and Miss Universe, Trump said he would go backstage before beauty pageant shows, the only man in the room while the women were “standing there with no clothes.” As the owner, “I sort of get away with things like that,” he added. He was not asked about Miss Teen USA in this interview.

E. Jean Carroll, a writer, said Trump raped her in 1996 in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room. Carroll wrote about the incident in her 2019 memoir called “What Do We Need Men For?” In May 2023, Carroll was awarded $5 million after a jury held Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation, though not rape. 

Temple Taggart, former Miss Utah, told The New York Times in 2016 that Trump “kissed me directly on the lips” when he met her at the 1997 Miss USA pageant and again when she met with him in Manhattan after he offered to help with her modeling career. Taggart described the incident as “inappropriate” and said her first thought after he kissed her was, “Oh my God, gross.” 

Cathy Heller told The Guardian in 2016 that Trump forcibly kissed her when she attended a Mother’s Day brunch at Mar-a-Lago in the 1990s. Heller said she was “angry and shaken” after the former president ignored her handshake, grabbed her and went for the lips and became angry when she tried to turn her head away. 

Amy Dorris, a former model, said Trump forcibly kissed and groped her in his private box at the U.S. Open tennis championship in 1997. Dorris told The Guardian in 2020 that Trump “shoved his tongue down my throat” and “his hands were very gropey and all over my butt, my breasts, my back, everything.” 

Karena Virginia, a yoga instructor and life coach, told The Washington Post in 2016 that Trump groped her, unexpectedly wrapping his arm around her and touching her breast, in 1998 while she waited for a car outside the U.S. Open.

Karen Johnson, who was a regular at Mar-a-Lago, said Trump pulled her behind a tapestry to kiss and grope her during a New Year’s Eve party in the early 2000s. Johnson detailed the incident to journalists Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy, who published it in their 2019 book, “All the President’s Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator,” along with 42 other allegations of sexual misconduct.

Bridget Sullivan, another former Miss USA contestant, told BuzzFeed News in 2016 that she met Trump at a party promoting the competition, and he hugged her “a little low on your back” and gave “a squeeze that your creepy uncle would.” In a separate instance in 2000, Sullivan said, Trump walked backstage while many of the contestants were naked or getting dressed.

Tasha Dixon, a former Miss USA contestant, told CBS in 2016 that, in 2001, Trump walked into where she and other contestants were changing. Dixon said she thought Trump “owned the pageant for the reasons to utilize his power to get around beautiful women.”

Melinda McGillivray told the Palm Beach Post in 2016 that Trump grabbed her butt without her consent in 2003 when they were backstage at a Ray Charles concert at Mar-a-Lago. 

Natasha Stoynoff, a former reporter for People magazine, wrote in 2016 that Trump sexually assaulted her in 2005 while she was visiting Mar-a-Lago to work on a story about his first year of marriage with Melania. When they were alone, Stoynoff said, Trump closed the door and pushed her against the wall before “forcing his tongue down my throat.” 

Juliet Huddy, a former Fox News anchor, said on the “Mornin!!! With Bill Schulz” podcast in 2017 that Trump kissed her unexpectedly and without her consent in Trump Tower in the mid-2000s. Huddy said she “didn’t feel threatened” at the time but later realized she would’ve said no more clearly. 

Rachel Crooks, a former receptionist at Trump Tower, told The New York Times in 2016 that Trump kissed her “directly on the mouth” without consent when she first met him in 2005. 

Samantha Holvey, a former Miss USA contestant, told CNN in 2016 that when she competed in 2006, Trump personally inspected each contestant, looking at them from head to toe like “sexual objects,” which made her feel “the dirtiest I felt in my entire life.” 

Ninni Laaksonen, a model and former Miss Finland, in 2016 told Ilta-Sanomat, a Finnish newspaper, that Trump squeezed her butt in 2006 when they were backstage at the “Late Show with David Letterman.” 

Jessica Drake, an actor in adult films, accused Trump during a 2016 news conference of grabbing her, kissing her without her consent and offering her $10,000 to come to his penthouse hotel room in 2006. 

Summer Zervos, a former contestant on “The Apprentice,” told reporters at a 2016 news conference that Trump sexually assaulted her on two separate occasions in 2007. The first was when she met him and he kissed her on the lips. Later that year, Zervos said Trump grabbed her shoulder, kissed her “aggressively,” placed his hand on her breast and thrust himself on her before she was able to pull away and leave the room. 

Cassandra Searles, a former Miss USA contestant, wrote in a 2016 Facebook post that Trump “continually grabbed my ass and invited me to his hotel room” when she competed in 2013. 

Alva Johnson, a former campaign staff member, alleged in a 2019 lawsuit that Trump grabbed her hand and kissed her on the side of the mouth without her consent during a rally in 2016.

Lol. He didn't reply. Odd.
Odd that none of that is proof. Where's the conviction and jail sentence?
"Right. So I guess those 34 felony convictions for stealing highly classified documents, keeping them in a golf course tool shed, repeatedly lying about having them, and repeatedly refusing to give them back. You definitely accept those as proof then. Right?

Because, he was convicted of those felonies. So, obviously, as you afore mentioned, you do accept those as proof of a crime. 

I mean, it would be super hypocritical and it show a complete lack of any intellectual honesty if you were to then come up with some bullshit excuse for him for crimes of which he was convicted. You know, since you claim ""lack of a conviction""  as an excuse for his other crimes. 

Only a complete idiot and a total piece of miserable worthless shit would do that, which I can only assume you are not. Therefore, I'm certain you personally consider him totally responsible for those felonies, of which he has been convicted, as well as all other felonies of which he has been, or will be convicted in a court of law. And I'm sure that you will join in being outaged if he does not go to prison for his crimes. 

So good to know there's good, fair minded people out there who set a consistent standard that holds everyone to account. Calling balls and strikes. Never moving the goal post. Good for you. /s"
That's what I thought. So SHTFU.

"Boy, sure is a lot of old accusations. Why did these women wait to come forward? Why did they go after money and not criminal charges? Hmmmmm.
Michael Jackson was also accused of child molestation but settled to avoid a costly court battle. Many people believe he was targeted for his money and that's generally accepted but he was also loved by many. Trump however is a demon so every accusation is real right? 

Now, show me proof where it was investigated and he was convicted of rape. Then I'll accept that he was a rapist. Just like every citizen in this country, innocent until proven guilty.

There's no proof here. Just women bringing up stuff many years after it supposedly happened while using for money. Little suspicious there."

"People who say scientology, the thing is, there's basically 2 kinds of scientologists:

1. The psychopaths who ""get it"", and become leadership

2. The mentally ill/vulnerable who are the targets/cash cows.

Very few ""normal"" people are scientologists. I guess maybe there's a 3rd category of people who were born into it. 

Personally, I find it pathetic the US government allowed them to infiltrate the IRS and get away with it. If I was president, I'd be sending out Delta/Team Six every night, screw the constitution."
"As a former Scientologist, that couldn’t be further from the truth. I am (was?) a second generation Scientologist. I didn’t have a choice in what to believe. How many actual Scientologists have you talked to, to make such a conclusion?

Just like any religion (they’re all bullshit) attracts people who are looking for something bigger, or looking for answers. They think they’ve found what they’re looking for so they stick around, because why wouldn’t you if you’re finding what you need? 

Most Scientologists, are normal people, that work right next to you, and you’d never know unless they told you. They’ve just been duped in to thinking that Scientology is going to save the world, and the only way that they can make that a reality is every Scientologist participates fully. 

I had some genuine gains in Scientology but for the most part I had to feign my gains, so that I wouldn’t get hit with a declare of some kind. I’d be willing to bet that the vast majority of them do the same, because the deeper in to it you get the more friends and family you have to lose."

"I'm a fraud analyst so I'm not surprised by anything anymore. Online romance scams are definitely the saddest and most disappointing. Your more successful scammers are professionals/teams of professionals and can intensely groom a victim for months before it escalates to money being requested.

But what always does it for me is we call people to investigate their fraud cases (if we can get them to answer their phone), and then they don't want to talk to *us* because they think we're scammers. I completely appreciate their suspicion, it's appropriate, but it's also kind of ironic. Please let me help you. 🙏😭"

One scam the father of my friend  fell for is the Hollywood thing we're a person gives you a cd claims there an up and coming star and that it's free then when you take it they usually guilt you in some way into giving them money .

"""Rent-to-own"" schemes for just about anything, but primarily nice to have things like TV's or furniture sets.

Consider rent-a-center, which has a ""Samsung 50"" The Frame QLED 4K Smart TV"" which you can rent-to-own for only $10 plus $39.99 per week! And after 87 weekly payments, it's yours to keep!

Except when you do the math, that works out to $3,489.13 worth of payments over about 20 months. Meanwhile, you could just buy that TV today directly off your favorite retailor for $749.99. If you got a loan today for that $750, and had to pay $3,489.13 over 20 months for that loan, you'd be paying *over 200% interest per year*. That's highway robbery.

If you were EVER going to consider this, just put the $750 TV on a credit card, that's even a better decision."

"I worked in fraud prevention, anti phishing, financial crime detection units for a few good years.

Generally speaking what’s interesting is that Al modern fraud still relies on the same principles of fraud from hundreds of years ago - and that people are still not taught the principles at any point well enough not to fall victims.

At the core you still have “advance fee” fraud which is 90% of what people fall victim to, so if I can do anything of value I’d say to people here: learn what advance fee fraud is and have it in mind whenever money changes hands.

At the core it’s when someone wants you to give them money before they give you money or goods: on Facebook marketplace it’s always “I want to buy the item you posted. Can you pay the courier by transfer/cash/buy the post label via this link” or some shit like that. On real-estate fraud it would be putting a deposit to secure a viewing of a (non-existent) apartment, or some variation of it.

Marketplace fraud is when someone sells you something that doesn’t exist, so that’s just about buying from safer vendors and using insured transfer methods rather than bank transfer or whatever else.

Advance fee fraud is the oldest trick in the book. Do not fall for it. Shit, I fought scams for nearly 20 years and I still need to be in complete awareness when I trade anything online. Be careful."

"The ""you are being served a criminal citation"" spam call. It's so obviously VERY fake.

I get spam calls for someone else, the person who had my phone number before me, presumably. This makes me very happy, so long as they aren't frequent, because it means the scam callers don't know anything about me. I'll worry a little the day they start using any name anything remotely like mine.

But every single time the call has one of two or three identifiable voices, it uses a *very* bad machine voice for the recipient so you know it's prefab, and it uses dumb, *deeply* unprofessional terms like ""the cops"" rather than ""law enforcement."" The very first time I heard one of these I was mildly concerned, but its scam nature became obvious very quickly. By now I must have gotten hundreds of the exact same scam calls. So....apparently *some* people still fall for it? But I honestly can't believe how brazen they are about repeating it literally identically for over 10 years."

"One scam that still surprises me for how effective it remains is the ""Tech Support"" scam. Despite being around for years, scammers continue to convince people that there's something wrong with their computer by posing as tech support representatives from reputable companies like Microsoft or Apple.

They'll often make unsolicited calls or display pop-up messages claiming that your device is infected with a virus. The scammer will then urge the victim to grant remote access to their computer or pay for unnecessary software or services. It's shocking because many people are aware of these scams, yet they persist, especially targeting those who may be less tech-savvy.

What’s really surprising is how convincing these scammers can be—they use legitimate-sounding jargon and fake caller IDs to impersonate real companies, preying on people’s fears of losing data or compromising their devices. Despite increased awareness, people still fall for it, mainly because of the scammers' pressure tactics and the element of urgency they create."

You would have thought a senior citizen would be aware that there is no such thing as a free money program, and she has used texting long enough to know about scams. This is the forth or fifth one she has been all ready to go on. I am so glad she at least asks what I think first. It makes me angry that these people prey on the elderly this way."

"Precious Metal IRAs. Aka Gold IRA.

Several companies do the same marketing to conservative boomers to roll over IRAs typically near retirement age to a so called safer Gold and Silver coins IRA.

The scam: 

They have coins minted for their own company. You can't shop them around. They claim they are premium coin and you get more than the spot bullion price because it has a collectible value.

There is NO market for these coins and they sell for the melt value anywhere else. You can't shop them out, dealers don't want them. They sell for 3-4 times the common spot prices of recognized coins like American Eagles.

If they have to sell, it goes back to the company dealer they bought them for. Almost always at a loss from original purchase.


These companies, are organized con men designed to face the elderly. There's no regulations or licenses. Some  just outright steal the money like Oxford Gold or Regal Assets and shut the doors.

Any you're seeing advertised by web ads, radio or on conservative TV, are scams.

People lose half or more of their roll over every time."

There’d be a bunch of boxes in the boot of the car and when people came up, one of the guys would grab one, open it, and show them the iPad in it. People would then give them money (a very small amount for an iPad) and one of the guys would grab another box from the pile and hand it to the customer. The customer would then walk off and the guys would drive away. Of course, there were no iPads in any of the boxes except for the one the guys were using to demonstrate. How come nobody noticed the weight differences between an empty box and a box with an iPad? Each box had a tile or something similar in it.

I assume people must have thought the iPads were stolen and that’s why they were going cheap, only to then get ripped off."

I heard her talking on the phone with the guy saying we don’t have that much cash and he was saying “oh well gather as much as you can and we can use that as a down payment” and she was getting all the money out of the registers and the safe which was probably less than $10k and I was like “wait, wtf are you doing???” And she explained and I was like stop you are being scammed. She was literally halfway out the door with bank bags full of money and it really made me question her intelligence and kinda made me wonder how tf she’s MY boss."

So, I looked it up online. Couldn't find it. Emailed the courts. They couldn't find it. Went down to the courthouse!! No clue. 

And I STILL didn't figure it out!

My dumb self thought the court messed up somewhere and that I had the ticket. Then I got a second letter for more because I didn't pay the 1st. So I went down to the courthouse and requested a court date. Because I couldn't pay the 1st one if I wanted to. Because no one could find it. 

Plus, please explain what this ticket is even for. The picture is at night. I can barely make out ""my car"", and the description of the infraction somehow doesn't explain what I did. 

Anyway, the other day, someone posted the exact same picture in my cities reddit page asking if it was a scam, and it absolutely is. And if I hadn't lost the scam paper, I probably would have paid it and never thought twice about it."

"There is a Discord scam going around right now where someone will message you that they accidentally reported your account. To correct it, they send you the contact information for “the owner of Discord” who asks for your username and password so they can login and “remove the false report”. 
I had someone in my server fall for this and insists that he spoke with the owner of Discord 🤦‍♀️ he ended up getting locked out of his account and had to make a new one."
"I’m blown away when I see people blindly sharing missing persons posts on social media that have absolutely no information about the person missing. These posts are usually made by someone posing as a family member of the missing to create a fake emergency situation in order to collect bogus donations. Usually the posts go from 0-100 in the blink of an eye. For instance, a post went viral in the city I live in a few weeks ago where an adult woman and her friend (late teens / early 20s) were picked up by “2 trusted men in a pickup” and haven’t been seen since”. The post then said “I believe it’s sex trafficking” even though the girls had only been gone for less than a day. 

Why did this seem scammy? Because the post was missing all of the following: The full name of the girl’s friend that was also missing, the description of the two trusted men, the description of their pickup, the full description of both girls, defining markings / tattoos, last known location, things that would actually help the community find these two girls. There was literally nothing in the post that actually gave the community any info on who was actually missing. The original poster would constantly delete then repost the same thing over and over once too many people asked questions that the person posting couldn’t answer. To top it off, the post had just one picture closeup of the two girls and that was it; no individual shots, no full body pics, no flood of information a loved one would put out there who’s looking to their community for assistance. Within 48 hours, the post had been shared thousands upon thousands of times across multiple states but at no point was any of the pertinent information given in any of these posts."

C. Literally no one is ""pushing"" gender affirming care on children. The only people who think that obviously made up lie is true are transphobes.

"This will prob make me sound like a crazy person, but…imho, the biggest scam is thinking that working to the bone 9-5 until you’re 65 is the ultimate dream and pinnacle of human living. Same with other modern day life like constant exposure to screens, bombarded with ads and consumerism, spending a lot of time indoors, relying on technology to do everything for us, etc etc etc. 

Basically we don’t use our bodies and brains as they’re built to be used. The desire to make survival less daunting has led us to turn into solitary creatures of comfort. Hyper individualism makes us lonely, depressed and anxious. We are social creatures that thrive on community and being active. Nature has pretty much everything we need, and we don’t have that knowledge like we used to. Our dopamine is also completely jacked up, making us less and less inclined to take care of ourselves in healthy ways. Physical exertion, providing for ourselves, serving each other in communities, having more time for pleasure and hobbies and socializing, this is how our ancestors experienced dopamine. It all works almost like a system, where our brain is getting a steady flow of dopamine. Compare to today, we are overwhelmed, tired, overworked, lonely, addicted to internet… our dopamine takes a big hit and crashes, making us feel bad, making us cope in unhealthy ways like endless scrolling, binge eating, smoking, drinking, hours of tv, etc just to get that immediate dopamine hit. 

I promise I’m not one of those paranoid conspiracy theorists or some hippy telling you to move to the woods and drink raw milk. I do love a lot of other aspects of modern life, like modern medicine and  all that, I just think power and greed has steered humans so beyond off course from what our bodies and minds are capable of and ways to spend our time that make us feel good and give us a purpose. Working 50 hours a week just to be able to barely have free time with our families, barely able to afford our mortgages and cars and insurance and bills and processed junk food, it’s all a way to keep consumerism and capitalism going. That is not a purpose, that’s straight up a scam."
This. I think about this everyday. 
Same. I try not to think about it too much because it’s so depressing lol.

"It's pointless to debate people like you, but I'm just going to leave a link to this book by the Human Rights Foundation here, for all the other people who might see your comment and are not opposed to learning:

[https://www.amazon.com/Check-Your-Financial-Privilege-Gladstein/dp/B09V2NM9VJ](https://www.amazon.com/Check-Your-Financial-Privilege-Gladstein/dp/B09V2NM9VJ)

>Alex Gladstein has a lot to say about Bitcoin, human rights, financial privilege, and personal freedom. In Check Your Financial Privilege, he says it, starting with the fact that anyone born into a reserve currency like the euro, yen, or pound has financial privilege over the 89% of the world population born into weaker systems.

>In Nigeria, human rights activists depend on Bitcoin for donations after crackdowns by authoritarian regimes. In Cuba, after a dual-currency system devalued the peso, those who saved in Bitcoin managed to stay afloat. In El Salvador, where remittance fees and exchange rates can eat away a simple money transfer to family members in need, Bitcoin offers hope with lower fees and faster transactions (and now it's legal tender).

>As CSO of the Human Rights Foundation, Gladstein is uniquely positioned to detail the rise of Bitcoin from cypherpunk dream to the real-life Bitcoin stories happening to real people across the globe. For people around the world, outside of Wall Street, Bitcoin offers a means of freedom from inflation, political strife, and an outdated monetary system. For these people, the majority of the world’s population, it might even save their lives.

>Proceeds from the sale of this book support the Human Rights Foundation."

Edit: this one seems to have hit a nerve, incels please note I'm not bothering with anymore responses, I'm entertained enough."
How is that a scam? People pay for a thing and they get the thing.
"Because a lot of people on there get convinced that the girl (or guy ,but mostly girl) actually likes them . Kind of the same way people think the stripper likes them ."
That's not a scam. That's people being naive as fuck.
It's a scam when the person getting the money actively plays into it and strings them along
Then they're just naive and maybe kind of stupid. That's not a scam though. They're still getting what they paid for. Nobody has promised monogamy or devotion to an OF customer.
I am sure it happens more than you think . Plus naivete could be applied as reason for falling for any scam.
"Except it's not a scam. It's just people catching feelings for people who don't like them back. And by ""people,"" I mean incels."
Sigh now I see the bias . Women fall for these kinds of things as well . I know from experience because I was a bad person when I was younger and was able to get them to fall for this kind of stuff . It's a scam . The person knows what they are doing to a weaker vulnerable person .
Ok bud. Sure you did. Sure you were.
"Last reply because there is no talking to people like you but yes I was a horrible person in the nineties . I took advantage of a lot of people . Men and women . Women were rather easy . A little romantic talk and I love you pretty much got you anything from money to drugs to a place to live . Intimacy and so call emotional connection can convince anyone to do what you want . Women are not free from this scam .


And it is a scam , making someone feel an emotional connection and leading them to believe it will lead to more for your own gain while knowing it won't , is a scam"
"If you can't see the difference between that and OF, I don't know what else to say. Sorry you feel you got scammed by a sex worker, but I'm willing to bet that she never promised you love or monogamy. OF is there for one reason."
Holy shit this is too fun not to respond . I have never paid a hooker or an of hooker . Not all men need that shit lmfao . It's a scam if you can't get past your own bias to see it I'm sorry for your ignorance. There are a lot of terrible people who prey on the weak and yes that includes your fellow of hookers.
"I'm not on OF, babe. I'm a fat old housewife. You're just another pathetic misogynistic incel."
"Nope I'm not an incel , married with 6 kids and three grandkids . I'm not the one singling out one gender I'm saying it happens to both genders . There are male and female OF hookers and there are male and female victims  . Do you forget lesbians and gay men exist?  Shocker but a lesbian subscriber can fall prey to a female OF hookers games as easily as a male and vice versa a gay man can fall prey to a male OF hookers games just as easily as a female  . It is pretty clear you are coming at this with a heavy bias . Hell I've never even accused you of being an OF hooker or attacked you personally at all . Too bad you can't say the same . Sad that people can't have civil conversations these days ."
"""Your fellow OF hookers"" means that I would also be one. That's what ""fellow"" means in that context. And yeah, I have a bias because I know that 99% of the people who subscribe to OF are straight men."
"Incorrect porn is shopped by everyone . Men , women , guys , straight , trans . No one is exempt . That includes women . Sorry your bias makes you blind to these facts but they are facts . I'll take back the "" fellow of hookers"" wasn't meant as an attack but can see how it is . See how civility works ."
"Jesus, she's pathetic isn't she?

She probably thinks selling heroin is fine too."
Man what a valid point
I didn't say anything about consuming porn. I was talking about people who PAY for OF.
It’s usually the bf doing all the messaging too.
True . I will say it's more often a man falling for these things but all genders are capable of falling for the tricks as well as being the predator playing the tricks

You can say that about any product
"I can say if you need to pay for a girlfriend experience, you have issues about any product?

Or are you trying to imply that advertising something flashy and taking advantage of loneliness are the same thing?"
Did you think an OF girl really liked you? Awww buddy.
"Are you resorting to personal attacks because you have no retort? How pathetic 😂.

"Voting for democrats.

 They promise the world, then when voted in, they don't come through on promises. They'll blame former republican presidents and gaslight their followers by way of the leftist media they own.

 They especially love to do this with the disenfranchised and minorities. They'll say anything and flip any position to achieve their goals. 

Total scam. Luckily, the people have woken up to this as seen in this year's election."
This take blatantly ignores the purposefully-obstructionist Congress doing their damnedest to make sure that Democrats get nothing done so that the GOP/MAGA can complain about Democrats getting nothing done.
"I don’t think that’s a nuanced take.

The truth is, sometimes they legitimately don’t have the amount of seats they need in Congress to get things passed. Biden passed BBB and the Inflation Reduction Act, but he had to make concessions because low turnout prevented him from getting the votes he needed right off the rip.

There’s nuance here. If you pay attention to what’s going on in Congress, you can clearly see that Democrats are *really* trying their hardest to fulfill their promises, while Republicans do literally everything and anything they can to stop them."
better than voting for a rapist and pedophile
"Democrats aren't leftists. They're centrists: And whether or not what they want to do is good (it's usually fine, if not a bit underwhelming), the reason they can never get anything done is because you people keep putting Republican contrarians in their way that block legislation. Or, when a Democrat president does a bunch of good, you all just kinda go ""lalalala can't hear you! Socialist! Communist! Liberal agenda!"" until a Republican president can come along and fuck it up again, at which point you somehow blame the Democrats, or simply lie to yourselves and say everything is fine.

I *wish* we had some left-wing representation. I'm sick of candidates who expect my vote but still try to pander to conservatives. I was happy to vote for Kamala Harris this year, but she lost a *ton* of left-wing support by staying too centrist, especially on certain issues. The big part is remaining ultimately pro-Israel (and therefore condoning the Palestinian genocide) which is a right-wing stance that too many leftists just couldn't abide by. Now, those leftists are still idiots for allowing the *worse* option to win—the guy who wants to help ""finish the job""—but morally, I understand their reasoning. It's a big and unfortunate example of what *always* happens when a Democrat becomes President: the right does what they do and slanders them to high hell, and the left grows too apathetic and frustrated to vote pragmatically. It sucks. Especially sucks that it happened in this election of all elections, when so much is at stake, both here and abroad. Damn shame. I can only hope the reluctant Trump-voters are right in predicting that it ""won't be that bad,"" but I remember his first term and I know what's changed. My hopes are not high this time around."
"Your lord and savior, Barack Hussein Obama, said that marriage was between a man and a woman. In a speech. In front of a camera. Chew on that."
"Oh god, you don't possess reading comprehension skills, do you? Did you miss the part where I *don't like Democrats?* How is he my ""lord and savior?"" You're projecting, bud—we don't worship politicians like you worship Trump. Especially the ones who lean too far to the right; y'know, like I *just fucking told you?* Lmao world's smartest conservative here, y'all. 

Did you think that would offend me or something? I'm more offended by the idiocy of the attempt, but really it's just kind of sad. Do better. Maybe address something I said next time.

Oh, and as a little cherry on top, just to fact check, he said that in 2008—years *before* he openly spoke of the ruling of Obergefell v. Hodges as ""a victory."" It's almost like he 1) believed something problematic and then grew as a person over several years (which we should commend someone, especially a politician, for doing), or even 2) simply said the wrong thing because he wasn't thinking. Worst case scenario, he pandered to conservatives, which I already told you I disapprove of and which *doesn't matter because I don't revere the guy as a saint.* He was just... a president. Relatively good one, as presidents go, but he was no messiah. In any case, I'm not gonna lose sleep about something a former President—from a party with which I don't align myself—said in a speech over 15 years ago... when I was in grade school.

Chew on that."
"Chew on this:

That was in the past. This is the present.

See, most people can adapt and change their thinking when presented with new information. They grow with the world around them instead of trying to conform it to their narrow view of it.

For some reason the GOP/MAGA have a real issue with absorbing new information and living in the present."
"Yeah, Trump just won in a landslide. That was also in the past."
"""Landslide?"" He got 2.5 million more votes than her. That's about 3% more. It's only a ""landslide"" if you count electoral college votes, but the EC was always skewed, so you shouldn't. It's hardly a measure of public favor. It's a technicalities game."
"[He won by about 3 million votes](https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/results/president?election-data-id=2024-PG&election-painting-mode=projection-with-lead&filter-key-races=false&filter-flipped=false&filter-remaining=false). That's not the landslide you wish it was, and it's far from a mandate to do the horrifying things he wants to do to this country."

"I know it's on a lot of social media chatting apps, but I know on discord, people call for the sketchy links. (Even my older brother did, and he's the smart one) those links someone will send you, (can be a thing to get into your discord, steam, Xbox, ANYTHING) 

But I got scammed a different way one time a year ago.
I was texting my friend, then I got a DM from someone saying ""I'm so, so sorry, I accidentally reported your STEAM account. I'm sorry! I thought I mass reported someone else! I meant to click the person under you in ____ server! I'm sorry! (They sent a screenshot)."" Look, I know. It's STUPID, but I fell for it. It didn't Dawn on me thinking (they have to do . multiple clicks to even report me. So, how did they do that and not notice???) Until my bf pointed it out. 

Anyways, then they said something about adding someone to my friends on discord to help me, saying they were working for steam. (Me not knowing that steam doesn't use discord or anything, didn't know better, so I did it) then they sent me a confirmation to my email to change my password. I don't know how, because I don't remember clicking ""reset"", but they got into my steam. I got it back, steam helped me instantly. Oh, BUT ON DISCORD I WAZ LAUGHING because I annoyed tf outta the steam ""mod"" (which had a bot logo, pretending to be a bot) and if i took tooooo long to reply, they got mad..but when i replied, I said stupid shit to annoy them cause I was pissed.

Also my brother got scammed and some dude took his discord account, and my bestie told me he can't get it back because he's never had nitro or anything. He's smart and knows discord, but IDK. My brother clicked on a link then was signed out he said.



Basically, don't be stupid like me and my brother.

A good friend of mine fell for it and right when he joined they asked him and all new members to each ask their family members for $20 but don't tell them what it's for. Turns out they just all used it to have lunch toguether and discuss the next level where they had to pay $300 to learn, the prices went up as the levels increased. They had everyone wear white like a cult and they had him shave his bread which is something he had always swore he would never do. I honestly didn't care until he started to reach out to all his female family members to get them to join, that shit is creepy.

And they always say yes, so I then say ""well, that's not my bosses name, you must have the wrong number"" and I hang up. I keep telling myself one day I'm going to keep talking to them and string them along and say ""oh, hey boss'!  Just to keep it going so I know why they keep calling and pretending to be the boss, but they always call while I'm super busy.  I work at a convenience store/gas station and have been there for fourteen years. The actual owner sold all his stores two years ago, so now I actually do have a boss with a similar accent to the caller - but - I know what my boss sounds like and I even got one a few weeks ago, so when the man on the other end said 'good morning, this is the owner of the business (not store owner, the 'owner of the business') I said, oh, I'm sorry, the owner isnt here right now - you can call back after lunch and he should be here"" just kind of stringing him a long with him a little to see what he would say and he said ""no, no, this IS the owner of the business"" i said ""really, what is my name"" and he just hung up, which was sad because i had a little time to play with him that day and was hoping to finally discover why I get at least one call every month or two from a fake ""owner of the business""."

Just reminding everyone here that scams often are made terrible on purpose. They want them to be ridiculous. The reason is easy: Their target are people being stressed out and not thinking to much about it. Once they do, they realize they fell for a *very obvious* scam. Knowing that, they hide it out of shame which is exactly the reason these scams are the way they are. 

It is not about not getting caught or getting as many people as possible, it is about the people you got hide it as long as possible from their superiors, their IT, etc... 

This is much more valuable for the scammer and the exact reason why you help the scammers if you shame victims or make fun of them. The next victim you may prevent from doing what he has to do after getting scammed: Reporting it to people that can get them out or lessen the damage."

I still can't believe he fell for it, especially after I read the texts between them and asked him to explain the entirety of their ""relationship.""

Classic signs of romance-for-monetary-gain manipulation:

\- In the beginning, spoke to him every day, flirting a lot, made him fall in love quickly, overly sexual to rope him in.

\- Wouldn't get into an official relationship with him until some court proceedings happened first between her and her ex and their mutual child.

\- Started her scam by asking money for small things (to gain his trust, of course).

\- Started asking for bigger things like lawyer fees to help expedite the process of them being together.

\- Used her child to emotionally manipulate him into helping her with the court money by stating the ex abused her and the child.

\- Hung out with him a couple times IN REAL LIFE. But always made an excuse not to be intimate, hug, cuddle, fuck, et cetera. She lived 4 hours away from him in another state.

\- After he was hooked, she would make excuses as to her phone being shut off, needing more money for that, and only texted him on the days he got paid. Basically kept being romantic a couple times a week and strung him along just enough to keep getting his paychecks. Minimal effort, maximum reward.

She used her real identity like an idiot, though..."

"Government pension systems. You pay enough tax get a shit ton of money if you invested in a basic investment fund until you retire (calculated this with my grandma's social security tax and she'd be a millionaire if invested in s&p500)

Instead you get a pension close to a minimum wage and the government can decide to change the age of retirement and to change the amount you get as pension and you can't do anything about it, oh and if you die before age of retirement your family gets nothing and all your payments were meaningless. 

Yet people still defend this system I don't understand.

Imagine if this was an investment plan ""Hey you pay a fix % of your income and at the age that we decide we will give you whatever amount of money we see fit and both those numbers can be changed any time we want"" No one would hire that investment plan but If you call it ""Government Pension"" suddenly everyone likes it."

My mom *almost* fell for that one, but I reminded her that we were in Canada, specifically the province of Quebec. Canada is a bilingual country officially (so all federal services are available in French and English) but specifically in Quebec, even if bilinguism is available for most goverment services (both on a provincial and federal level), French *always* have to come first.

When I got the exact same call, I told her not to worry about it. The person who was attempting to scam us was clearly unaware of the laws, because the recorded message was *only* in English. Any recorded message would be either in the language of your choice (In my mom's case, French) or at least bilingual (And since we are in Quebec, French first, English second)"

"Nigerian prince 419 / Spanish prisoner scam. It’s over 400 years old, and claims victims every day still.

A couple of decades ago when I was working on anti-spam solutions I remember it being the #1 source of income to Nigeria, and the samples we were processing were so crazy I couldn’t believe people fell for it still.

That said, I knew the psychology and the reason it was so obvious- they needed to target only the most naive of people, so sending emails that were so clearly too good to be true, meant they would get responses from only the people most likely to fall for the whole thing.

A cool example from around 1900 with all letters and police notes can be explored here: https://history.denverlibrary.org/news/very-old-fence-fresh-coat-paint"

"This should be on top.  I don't understand how Americans can be convinced to borrow more money than most will ever save in their life outside of maybe retirements, to get a degree that no one outside academia values.  Basically, I was blow away to see Americans get degrees in their hobbies/interests.  We used to have a few colleges that allowed you to ""design"" your own major.  You wouldn't believe the obscure, non-applicable topics some kids would get degrees in.  Now it was okay, because most of them had trust funds and would end up in law school if they couldn't find a job at daddy's line of work.  Many of them would then go find some interesting work to do. The catch was they were supporting themselves with family money.  You and I would actually think that you can make six figures and live in some expensive places, with a degree in something like ""Pokemons"".  Nope, it was all trust funded."
"I went to an American school for some time, and yes, you are right. I believe i saw upwards of 60% taking degrees in things like specific philosophies, arts, music, and some phd's in history. 

Nothing wrong with said degrees, but those either require no degree to make it to the top, only have jobs that will keep you in debt for three decades, or are jobs that will only open up one at a time when a professor retires."

You can’t get out of these and they usually don’t ever provide what they say they will in there presentations.  They will lie to your face over and over again.  Then you feel “pressured to sign” and the document has a completely different set of terms than you were told.  

I sat in on 2 different presentations in my life.   What was supposed to be a 2 hour presentation was each time over 4 hours and they hold you hostage as in both cases they picked us up from a hotel and brought us to this fancy resort and wined and dined us.   I made it clear that I would need to have a lawyer and my accountant look over the terms and they wouldn’t let me take a copy of the documents.  Each time I got something out of it. At least they were honest there.  In Mexico I got a week paid for rental car and 100 bucks cash.  The one in Florida we got 300 bucks cash.   My ex at the time would have signed if I hadn’t been there!  She was so sold on it.  That’s how I know how easy it is for people to fall for these. She was very smart but fell for it.

Any and all points(I think that’s what they’re called) are passed to her children.  The ultimate scammy part is there is no way you will use it to its fullest in your lifetime.

Sounds like most of the time they just take your monthly fee (which is not as affordable as they claim it is) and can take months to match you with a therapist, even though they're still taking your money. I had a queer friend whose BetterHelp ""therapist"" suggested conversion therapy to them lol turns out none of the ""therapists"" they hire are properly vetted, you can essentially just sign up to be a counselor. It's insane."

Having to move convos to another platform, sob story’s, moving money from 3rd party apps, not using things that can be traced back to anyone, money orders, having to jump through multiple hoops to get anything done, strangers texting you, sending confirmation texts or verification codes to literally anyone except for yourself, gift cards, someone claiming to be from a collection service or IRS (they will send letters), clicking on links (something you should try to limit if you don’t already) from unknown people. The list goes on and on. When a stranger comes into your life, or a “friend” on social media messages you and something feels off and they’re requesting you to do anything, why would anyone trust that literally ever"

She's part of a whole ecosystem of entrepreneurs and coaches who either have weathy husbands or a real job.

"Homeopathy. I'm not talking about your avarage person, the placebo effect is real (especially when it concerns pain management), but there's an actual pharmacist in my town that went to uni for 6 years and tried to give me homeopathy in stead of the anti viral meds my doctor prescribed. These are for genital herpes (got it from a stupid cold sore, not even the fun way...). Fevers during these attacks can be so high they can cause brain damage. 'take this tablet made of a chemical sugar replacement and chemically extracted lactose from milk that's been doused by magically shaken water, it's all natural in stead of that chemical crap'...

There's nothing natural or herbal about homeopathy, it's a pseudo science that relies on the belief of water molecules having 'memory'. It's esoteric (like tarot cards and ear candles), not herbal (like using eucalyptus to free up your nose).

I hate it when people who are actually smart themselves call homeopathy herbal, most regular medicine contain more natural ingredients than those tablets."

Then the scammers hit up for shipping and all sorts of BS and of course you’re never getting a puppy.

"Card cracking. It's really more of a way of embezzling money from a bank than an out and out scram. For those who've never heard of it, it works like this.

People advertise on Facebook and other social media for anyone that has a checking account with a debit card. They target people who have little or no money in their  accounts, especially college students. They then get the person with the debit card to give it to them along with the PIN number. Then they deposit a fake check into the account and use the debit card at an ATM to withdraw the money immediately. The person who owns the checking account reports the card stolen and the person who deposited the fake check gives them part of the money as a kickback. Of course, it's illegal as hell for all involved."

He really tried convincing me to come to a “family meeting” to discuss it more. I am so proud of the fact that 20 year old me was very suspicious. These were some relatives I would’ve loved to reconnect with, but the situation just gave me a weird feeling. And I was a timid person at that age who had a hard time saying no to people. Thank goodness I did.

Later had an uncle (from a different side of the family) trying to get me to join his wife’s MLM scheme. Rejected that “opportunity” as well.

Oh, also rejected an old coworkers MLM.

Maybe I just saw through the scheme? It always shocked me how easily people fell for these - some of them being older people I respected. And at 20 or so, I had better judgement."

The summer before I started college, I got a phone call on a Sunday (should have been my first clue). The lady on the phone told me that I had been selected for a federal grant for something like $20k to help pay for my school. I just needed to provide my bank account number and routing number so they could transfer the money to me directly.

Being naive, poor, and excited, I provided the information. Once I hung up, it only took a few minutes to get a sinking feeling that maybe that was not legit and that maybe I had just given my bank account information to someone with malicious intent. Huge facepalm moment.

First thing the next morning, I went to my bank, closed out that account, and opened a new one. Luckily they hadn't done anything yet, but if common sense hadn't taken over, I would have been screwed."

"Multi level marketing (MLMs). I’m amazed people still buy into this. They promise you’ll be your own boss, make thousands working from home, and all you need to do is recruit your friends and family to sell overpriced protein shakes, makeup, or essential oils.

What’s crazy is how much they prey on people who are struggling financially or looking for a way out of their 9 to5 grind. They’ll parade around flashy cars and fake success stories, but the truth is, most people lose money. Like, you’re not building a business, you’re buying into a pyramid scheme with extra steps.

And yet every year a new MLM pops up with a fresh spin, and people still fall for it. It’s all the same. you invest your savings into a starter kit, alienate your loved ones trying to sell them stuff they don’t need, and eventually, you’re left broke and ghosted by the people who roped you in.

It’s the same scam, repackaged, and it’s shocking how it keeps working."

"When people get the calls where someone tells them they're the FBI or something serious, and make them go to Target and get like $1000 dollars worth of Visa gift cards, then proceed to ask then to read the card numbers back to them.

I did assets protection for Target a while back, and one day, I got a call to come up front. There was man on his phone frantically asking where the visa gift cards were, I mean this dude literally looked like the was running out of time. 

It all worked out in the end. It was just a lot for something so easily avoidable, yet equally as surprising that someone is still using this scam."
"Worked at a pizza shop and one night we got a random call that my manager picked up. For context it’s a franchise so the owners are the only step above manager and it’s very small. The call claimed to be corporate and that they needed the manager to take all the cash from the safe and buy visa gift cards and to text them the picture of them.
Without double checking with the owners or anything, dude just empties the safe and does exactly that. Couple thousand dollars spent on Visa cards and given to these random dudes who said they were corporate.

The manager is someone I think is pretty intelligent and was thought everyone was pranking me when they told me what happened. I’m buddies w the manager and we hang out outside of work so I wasn’t going to press it but what the actual fuck was going through his mind?

If corporate showed up in person and asked me to do that shit I’d say hell nah I ain’t holding all your money and being a walking lick for anyone to rob me.

Dude felt like the biggest dumbass because of it and insisted on repaying the business. We are almost certain tho the business has theft insurance like that as they mentioned it, and still wanted the manager to pay them back. Dude emptied his savings account to make the business almost whole."

"People who still thinks a scam is a scam when it's all in the mindset and blame others for their own failings. Why is it that it works for some and not for others? What's so different from people who succeed comparing to people who keep failing? I bet you the vast majority will already have made up their minds and call it a scam before they've even started or even attempt to delve further. How do they know when they haven't experienced it? Can you say for definite and without question that if you go to another country and without trying the local delicacy that the food will be disgusting?

Yes, there are real scams out there but the vast majority have a system in place that like MLM or Network Marketing that do work but people who don't understand it or even attempted it, the first thing they will say, without further thought, it is a pyramid scheme. 

These people still think an employment hierarchy is not a pyramid scheme even though it's shaped like a pyramid just like in MLM and Network Marketing. They see it and accept it as the only way because they've been programmed through education and their environment to accept it this way from their early years to adulthood. They have no conscious thought about it , they won't and don't want to delve further because that's what they have been programmed to think like that.

MLM and Network Marketing is a scam because they can't see it or don't want to see it as an alternative."

"XRVAP is a crappy, cheap steam cleaning machine that hires people with no qualifications, other than a driver’s license, to sell it. Doesn’t sound that bad, right?

The machine costs $4500 USD and looks like it was designed in the 80s. You can easily find something better for $200.

Here’s the deal:

* ""Employees"" have to buy the machine before they can sell it.
* They have to memorize a script and can’t deviate from it.
* They’re pushed to target their family and friends.
* They’re only paid on commission.
* There’s a program that tries to lure clients in, where if you arrange a few meetings with your friends, you earn points for stuff like “free” theme park tickets.
* If you call a friend and book a meeting right now, your points turn into “kangaroo” points and double (wtf?).

Basically, they scam people with low incomes and no education into spending their last savings on a cheap machine.

It also seems like a shady pyramid scheme because my girlfriend’s nephew told us that if we didn’t sign right away, but waited until the next day, his superior would get a bigger commission on the sale.

It looks like someone bought a huge stock of those unsold crappy machines after the original manufacturer bankrupted and rebranded them.

Dental/health insurance
"Health insurance is another issue but you should be getting your teeth cleaned twice a year by a dentist to make sure your teeth are in good condition. Most insurance makes that free. Similarly health insurance makes regular checkups either free or very cheap.

Additionally you save immense money with insurance when you need to get something fixed."
Cash price is almost always cheaper with medical in my experience which I admit isn’t much. However I do have plenty of experience with dental insurance and there are far better alternatives to it- like discount plans and the like.

"Crypto. 

You pay real money to put on a ledger that you own a fraction of a monopoly paper. People assume there's this 'demand' that floats the valuation. but most of bitcoin is owned by 10 holders. If the big players got in at 1k or less then they have vast multiples of value by only selling a tenth of their holdings. It doesn't matter if another coin never sells again. Its not a stock that's tied to a real company's performance or anything. Nothing stops the big players from holding to keep a high value or trading between each other to fake activity.

At least with a bank, there's some vault with tangible assets people will value even in a huge recession. Might be a fraction of what's supposed to be there with fractional reserves, but the rest of it is tied up in other asset ventures of the bank. So the rest of the money is still tied to the bank."
"I hear ya, but I guess the crypto appeal is like that ""mystery box"" effect—what's inside could be crazy valuable or, well, just a bunch of air. Sure, Bitcoin's volatility is legendary, but then again, have you seen the average banking fee lately? Banks feel secure until they slap those needless charges and you're wondering why your money gets skimmed harder than milk.

For those crunching numbers or dodging the crypto chaos, using Aritas Advisors alongside tools like Mint or Wealthfront gives businesses and individuals a clearer picture of their finances, offering real strategies against financial unpredictability."

However bitcoin is quite energy intensive to mine, and slow, but that's a challenge for newer better cryptos to solve, like litecoin, or cardano etc."
"It’s literally just made up. It’s provides no value to anything, is based off nothing, and as you said yourself, costs money to “mine” whatever that actually means. It’s scam for tech bros."
"fiat money is juist as made up, money is abstract number to do exchanges, and bitcoin provides that mechanism, and digital scarcity, that ensured it cannot be printed into infinity like fiat can. This scarcity makes it behave more like a physical object than digital data, as digital data can be copies, but bitcoin cannot, it can only be moved around. There are markets for crypto that provide it with value by supply vs demand. There are identical blockchains where the coins have no value, they only differ by having a free faucet to make infinite coins, therefore breaking the scarcity, they are called testnets as they are useful for testing features without financial cost. Real bitcoin mainnet doesn't haver afaucet so its 21M coins are all there will ever be, and that gives them value, because you can only buy them, and not copy them or create any more than the mined ones (that cost energy to mine, not free) for yourself out of thin air.

I guess you just don't understand that much about what it is and that gives you that Dunning-Kruger confidence in ""knowing"" its a scam. It's just a finite unforgeable asset usable for storing value without inflation and for payments."

"OK, this is sad, and also hilarious. Long read.

Way back when my husband and I could barely afford our new mtg, (we live in California) we had three extra bedrooms, nice House. So we got roommates. 

One of them was a sweet, college educated, but not street smart girl, wide-eyed, fresh from Wyoming.  She mets a real nice guy that's as naive as she was. 

One day we came in from work and they're both there, all excited. Says they have to talk to us, it's important. So we go change, come back to the living room, and they're both waiting. 

She proceeded to give us her presentation. Amway. She had done actual spread sheets calculating what the household collectively spent on everyday items, and demanded to know what we spent on everything from shampoo to window cleaner.

Then he pulled out the Amway catalog, and started showing us what great products we ""will be using from now on."" OK then! 

We felt really bad about bursting her bubble. She was invincible. Would not stop, getting very aggressive, ""why wouldn't you want to save all this money???""

But then, she goes a bridge too far*. Husband asks her where is she going to put all this inventory she's going to need? 

In our garage. Husband doesn't need to park there, she's already figured out the sq footage that was needed, and it was only half the garage. We just needed to move some stuff. I could see my husbands' eyes narrow, and he began his own presentation.(Usually a calm redheaded musician).

No way, uh,uh, no. Hell no. She wants to know why, he says he owns the garage. She says, well she pays rent. He says, go read your contract, show me where it says you have access to the garage unless granted by the homeowners, us. 

I felt so bad for the two of them, but they just wouldn't give it up. We started raising their rent until they finally gave notice. I don't know what became of them, but I had to give them credit, if any one was going to make it to the Platinum Club, it was them."

"(1) Disinfecting surfaces to supposedly kill viruses, and (2) Government authorities saying they are testing sewage for viruses. 

\* There is not any such thing as a virus living on a surface such as a countertop. Viruses are very fragile and can only be alive when they are inside another living organism. As soon as they come out - they are dead and cease to exist. Labs cannot even grow a virus on a plain petri dish like they can grow bacteria. They can only grow viruses in live animals or in live animal cells. 

\* For the same reason as above, there are no viruses in waste water and no known lab tests for that. When the government makes special scary announcements in the news that they have found measles or covid virus in waste water in some cities, they are making that up to mess with you."

"Rooftop solar!  Probably does make sense in a few places, but its a straight scam here.  $25k and a monthly service charge on a product that loses 2-4% effectiveness every year to cut down my electric bill from $200 to $50 but only in the summer.  Yeah, that seems like a good idea...  I get someone coming by almost every month."

"Donald Trump. He's a literal con man. Just watch him talk about the bible. He tells people he's a Christian, but can't even pronounce II Corinthians correctly. He says ""two Corinthians"" like it's a story about a couple of dudes. He's never heard an actual church sermon before. I'm an atheist and I could kick his ass in a bible contest. When asked directly to name a favorite verse, he dodges because he doesn't know any."

"Why have I had to scroll this far and still not seen **trickle down economics**?

It's by far one of the most toxic scams in America that has been disproven everyday since it was theorized. Yet millions of people get conned by right-wing media and politicians into giving CEOs and mega business owners all these tax cuts so they can make even more obscene wealth while you struggle to buy eggs and cars and a home. 

It's fucking tragic watching so many people destroy their own futures with a vote."

"Anything to do with American politics, especially the Democratic party, but it's not limited to them of course.

The astroturfing was off the charts this year. The candidate who lost showed up as drunk as the sitting president is demented to the debate, but everyone pretended it was normal."
"Bras. Society pushes this idea that bras are somehow essential for women’s bodies, claiming they offer 'support' and 'prevent sagging,' but these are just myths created by companies looking to profit. There’s no real scientific evidence that bras benefit breast health or appearance—in fact, they can actually cause harm by weakening natural support and limiting circulation. They’re uncomfortable, often expensive, and entirely unnecessary.

And when it comes to health risks, people like to point to the 2014 Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center study to 'prove' bras don’t cause cancer. But that study is flawed. It was short-term, with a small participant pool, and it didn’t look at essential factors like bra fit, wear duration, or physiological impacts. Plus, it relied heavily on self-reported data, which is often unreliable. So really, the claim that bras are harmless doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. The idea that women 'need' to wear bras is a scam, pushed by an industry preying on insecurities. Our bodies are perfectly designed as they are!"

Even if that was the case (it's entirely unconfirmed hearsay) that doesn't change the fact that it was real and killed millions.
"Lazy answer: Trumpism.

Less lazy answer: Online or on-app romance scams. I once talked to someone who wanted me to help him get back $40,000 that he'd paid over the course of a year to a lawyer and a travel agent, to get his girlfriend immigration status from Korea. A very short consultation revealed that he had never met this girlfriend in person, or any of these professionals who, he was assured, could help bring her to him; nor was there any reliable documentation of the money he'd given them. He was not happy at the suggestion that there probably was no lawyer, no travel agent, no girlfriend in Korea, and no way to get this money back, months after the fact. 

It happened to a friend of mine, too: she was at one point excitedly talking about her new girlfriend, who she'd met over Tinder, and who was going to come stay with her. I thought it was a real thing. Until she then learned that this woman was a ""jewelry dealer"" of some sort, and was detained in Russia, because the Russian government had seized her stock, and she needed to pay $20,000 to corrupt officials to get it back... and then she confessed, no, she'd never actually met this person with her face. I had to gently break it to her that she probably did not have a girlfriend, she probably had a scam problem. My friend is not stupid. She just wanted it to be true."

"It's not necessarily that VPNs are a scam.  There are genuine uses for them.  It's just the advertising behind them that makes promises that are ..... Not entirely wrong but not entirely honest either.

Tom Scott did a piece on them that probably paints a better picture than I could.

lxp2up4,Copper bracelets.
lxqwms6,Had a family friend in the 90s who was involved in a copper health products MLM. Do I get double points?
lye2unp,"Yes, if you sign up five more people"
lxwg4yk,">Washington, D.C. - November 8, 2019 - A new study has found that copper hospital beds in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) harbored an average of 95 percent fewer bacteria than conventional hospital beds, and maintained these low-risk levels throughout patients’ stay in hospital. The research is published this week in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, a journal of the American Society for Microbiology.

lxyznkp,"Yes. The antimicrobial power of copper is well known but that’s not what the MLM group was selling. They claimed arthritis improves and my family friend claimed her husband’s cataplexy and narcolepsy improved when sleeping on a mattress embedded with copper. There was a magnetic component in there, too. (IK copper is not magnetic. I may have some details wrong - it’s been decades and I thought it was BS at the time."
lxrg6ib,Those were obviously a scam.  I only buy ionic bracelets.
lxv29t2,Nah bro! Those hologram stickers beat them hands down in that study the aliens did that got suppressed by the government and pharma bros.
lxrq8cz,Have fun with wrist cancer!
lxpz63c,"lol. I love these ads. I've never bought one, but every time I see an ad for one...bracelets, socks, shirts, whatever...I sit there and think, ""shit, that is exactly what I need.""

lol."
lxs7t31,"I had a few because they were pretty (Celtic knotwork engraving), and when I stopped wearing bracelets because they got in the way of the keyboard and cash register, I developed tendinitis in my wrists!  Coincidence?  I think so!  I mean, it couldn’t have anything to do with being a full-time college student while also working 30-35 hours a week as a cashier, right?  (Do I really need to add the /s?)"
ly0ivfo,"> Do I really need to add the /s?

No. And if anyone ever doesn't get it without the /s, you block them and are happy to know there's one less user not ever worth dealing with."
lxrd7co,All of my golfer friends and wore these in the 90s.  That green stain on our wrists showed how serious we were about the game.
lxs6kzh,Ea Nasir is still at his old ways.
lxuq7hv,Nanni is a legend.
lxsdsll,"Nothing upsets me more than making jewelry with copper and seeing people in the same market making the same thing but adding, “healing properties” or “natural healing remedy” to their website/shop/jewelry listings. It’s predatory behavior and I guarantee 99% of them don’t believe it themselves."
lxq2hen,Some of them are cool looking though.
lxrq5ls,"If you want cool looking jewelry, buy jewelry. But the scam is that a lot of people buy these for more money or at all specifically because of the promise of health benefits. That's textbook false advertising and every single one of these companies should have all assets seized"
lxqwlzc,...and non stick pans.
lxrkz52,Surely you don’t mean the impugn the stellar reputation of the Chi Chi Rodriguez Magnetic Golf Bracelet!
lxpiulb,An oldie!
lxt8dew,I got some good ones from an acquaintance named Ea-nāṣir. No complaints so far.
lxx9fml,But have you seen the copper sheets for your bed??????
lyie5zv,Hahahah yo I just snorted  on that one.  So true
lxoyu25,Those sites that make you do hours of work by downloading shady apps and watching endless ads just to get you 20% of the way to getting a $5 target gift card
lxp4chj,"Prize rebel. I was 12 years old, and gave my newly built computer every form of digital STD imaginable. Lesson learned."
lxpx5y1,When I was 12 I really did earn $20 answering marketing surveys from an old site called inboxdollars. I had to explain to my mom why I was mailed a check. Sounds like an area rife for scamming today
lxpxfqi,Been an area rife with scams since the Late 00's.
lxsdjpc,"Women, relationships, kids — why even bother..?"
lxtzvnx,name fits
lxror4f,Yeah I made $100 from doing surveys but I stopped because it was just the biggest pain in the ass I'd rather be raking leaves and mowing lawns.
lxspcmh,Made 0.6 Bitcoins filling out 2 surveys. was worth maybe $0.10 at the time. Sold in Dec 2020...
lxr06dt,"i have been talking to robots for about a year now.  have made 100$ish for a few hours of forecasting.

trying to get more gigs but they fill up quick."
lxs3n8x,You talk to robots for money?
lxsadu2,I think they must be talking about training A.I. From what I have read it pays well. It’s usually always work from home.
lxsjmrc,"It does pay well (depending on where you live), but it's not consistent work.

I do it on the side for around $18 an hour when I'm bored and there's work available, some of the work is fun, some of the work is very painstakingly boring.

I will say it's neat to see an AI ""grow"".

Nearly all of the AI training is under NDA's, so it's hard to give any more information, but if you like typing/researching and are looking for a side gig, I recommend it."
lxsjzdj,How do you do this??? any sites????
lxslgzp,Sorry I don't know any platforms that are currently recruiting. I'm not looking for new work at the moment so I don't keep up to date as well as I probably should.
lxsg6c6,"yup.

not much money but easy work.  they ask you to look at data and then write out how you would extrapolate it.  then the robots study everyone's answers and come back at a later meeting and ask the question again but this time they have crafted the question using the answers from the first round...  and so on.

i parsed the same data 4 times over the summer and each time the questions came back a bit cleaner and direct."
lxta0ok,What's the site? I may be interested in training AI
lxs3s2g,"InboxDollars did work for a while, but the amount of time you spent on it, was not worth what they sent you."
lxqjz0s,It was usually always a scam but you needed more than 1 device and to be there early to make a lot of money. For example I made almost $10k in a year just babysitting a bunch of devices. I built 2 computers from those sites.
lxsaolx,I did inboxdollars back in the day!
lxsq4de,I remember that! Got a $30 gift card from them.
lxtl5kj,I got $60 from them! Loved that site when I had nothing else to do
lxw4hec,"When I was 12, my friends and I would make $2-$3 answering surveys at the mall, $5 at absolute most (and that was a one off).
An adult would seek out teenagers, bring them back to some back office room, ask 10-20 questions, pay them and send them on their way."
ly1zy7k,i used to rack up frequent flyer miles on inbox dollars. like I was actually taking a trip a month. (my job had a lot of downtime.) probably can't do that anymore.
lxu2bcu,"Hey inboxdollars is legit!! It's a time suck, but if you're desperate, it's something!!"
lxpv2sh,"Remember trying out one of those as a high schooler to try to get a free iPod touch lol. Yea….didn’t make it far. Wish I had “fallen” for bitcoin instead, but my shitty instinct told me that was a scam."
lxq1tw4,"Me being 16 and watching a bitcoin documentary about it and saw I could by 1 bitcoin for 50 cents after watching it and saw the potential. But not being old enough for PayPal or a credit card I couldn’t do shit. 

Guess what exploded when I turned 18?"
lxtgoqx,"I mean, to be fair, if it were 50 cents while you were 16, then when you were 18, it was probably still very cheap. But in your defense, even if it were like 50-100 bucks by then, who could’ve guessed that it would reach tens of thousands of dollars? very few people did. Guess we can all just take solice in the fact that we probably would’ve sold looong before the peak even if we did get bitcoin at sub $1000."
lxtnfde,"If I recall the times correctly it was steadily on the rise and someone who was actually paying attention to it would have seen it coming. By the time I was 19 is when the first boom happened but sadly I was not paying attention to it after not being able to buy it when I first learned about it and having forgot about it. 

But you correct about all of that, none of us knew who the fuck knew."
lxqay60,Most crypto is more or less a scam in fairness.
lxtvbch,"I remember reading about it in my apartment in grad school when it hit I think $3. I even had the right hardware to be able to mine something back then (a Radeon 4770). But then I hit the part where oh it's not just downloading the wallet you need to set up the miner, ""well whatever the ship must have already sailed if I'm reading about it in the mainstream non-tech press"". :(

Later fucked around with dogecoin mining for fun a couple of years later and was retroactively kicking myself for being lazy that day, getting the doge mining set up (so I assume bitcoin mining would have been similar effort) turned out to right about the same level of effort as flashing custom Android ROMs, which I did a lot of in grad school. Even similar pain points like finding a good guide you feel confident about following potentially taking more time than actually following the guide.

The real question of course is how long would any of us have held. A lot of us would have definitely sold the first time it hit $100. Maybe an easier decision to just wait and see if you only had a couple of coins but if you had even 1,000 coins when it hits $100 are you really gonna hold?"
lxu8vpg,"Exactly. I bet a MOST early investors sold at less than $200, especially if they couldn’t envision its potential. I definitely would’ve been one of those sellers even if I’d gotten into it early. 100k would be life changing money to me even now. I only know of like a handful of publicized people who got into it early and never sold until they were rich rich. One of those people is that black guy on YouTube who was practically begging people to buy even just one….when it was at less than $10. (Think it was in 2012 or something). And it seems to me a lot of earlier investors who held a long time or are still holding were already not even close to broke to begin with. Read of a guy who put like 12k into bitcoin early on, and then “forgot” about it till like 2021…..like who else but the already “comfortable” can invest 12k into something and just forget about it like it’s a 10er in your old wallet?"
lxpe3uq,Digital STD is amazing 😂😂👏
lxrpslp,"Haha, that's the site i used too. While it's shady and not at all worth your time, i did find it rather helpful. When I was a teen, i was too young to get a bank account and my mom was deathly opposed to buying anything online, so I used PR to buy a few minecraft key codes for me and a couple friends. Which led to a 8 year addiction to the game & joining a community that i still play with and consider my closest friends. To me it was well worth the 3 months of time wasting ""work"" filling out hundreds of surveys, but I'd never recommend it to anyone as an actual source of income. 

At least i was somewhat smart about it though (and probably broke half of PR's T&C). I used an alias, fake address (i checked to make sure there wasn't actually a house there), an old prepaid cell phone, an old laptop i didn't care about, a sandboxed browser, antivirus, antimalware, public wifi, the works. The computer was getting multiple viruses every time I used it, and i just kept the phone off because it was getting so many spam calls and texts lol."
lxr4ab7,Lmfao this is hilarious 🤣🤣 STD's everywhere
lxr54ep,My brother used prize rebel and saved up enough to buy the 3ds and said never again months of grinding.maybe even years
lxt5xi7,"I got a few things off of that site.


15 years later I'm still getting spam emails from it lol"
lydg6f1,"damn, blast from the past"
lxphtc5,🤣🤣🤣
lxqvrg0,"When I was younger (I think right around 14 y/o), there was a service that would pay you if you went to McDonalds, order a meal, write your experience and submit that. It did actually work: I got my meal payed for and I think around 8$ of compensation. But the whole process was such a pita that it was never worth it."
lxrmo31,I got my copy of The Orange Box from prize rebel when I was a teen lmao
m0lb347,Why didn't you just use a VM to test everything in? Malware preventative solution - check ✅ 
lxp5ohn,"There used to exist community forums where you could outsource this work.

You may remember the “WIN AN XBOX 360” or similar, and you’d do an offer and be told you needed to get other people to complete “1 platinum offer” or “4 gold offers” or “10 bronze offers.”

And everybody thought it was a scam you couldn’t win - except you 100% could, and people did.

People built whole forums around trading offers with other people - they would workout the prize cost, let’s say $500, and offer people money to confirm/do offers for them.

As a poor college kid I made a decent amount of extra spending cash just helping people by getting a free month of Netflix, or paying $1 on a trial at X stupid website."
lxpsn6d,"Not sure if they still do, but Amazon had a site around 2012-2015 where you could go to do all sorts of basic nonsense tasks like rating images, answering surveys, etc. Most of them paid pennies, but you could filter by award amount and get some that paid 25-50 cents, or even a dollar or more sometimes. Usually for just a couple seconds of work.

Not a massive game changer, but as a broke college kid, sitting on my laptop burning 20-30 minutes on it here and there paid for a McChicken or two per week, as well as my monthly runescape subscription. Lol"
lxq03w5,Amazon Turk!  Haven't done it in a while but it can be good if you're tech savvy enough!
lxrjvq9,*Mechanical* Turk is what it was called
lxq0nou,That's the one! Still around? Been YEARS since I was doing it haha
lxqk51k,Yes but it's not as lucrative. If you invested a lot of time into it and learned to work the system you could make $5000 a month.
lxq6bye,I have no idea. I've fortunately been able to pick myself up for the most part enough to not have to rely on these types of sites anymore.
ly2i0fu,I think AI has ruined MTurk. I haven't' done anything there in two years. Just not worth it anymore.
lxqi8xc,Yes but people in India will do the same work cheaper than you.
lxtrtuu,"That's the point,  its a digital sweatshop like fiver and a lot of other ""freelance"" websites"
lxry6mk,"I was going to try and get invite for Amazon Vine where they send you stuff and you review it. 

I have never heard of Amazon Turk. May not be as good back in the day. Any decent rewards or just bleh today?"
lxsl9uh,"Most of the stuff on Vine are junk now. Plus you have to pay taxes on what you got for free, you have to reach 100 items with like 90% reviewed in 6 months to get to ""gold"" where you get items above $100. I got some decent things from Vine that I was able to sell on Market place but it became more work than it was worth."
lxsz1be,"Hey yeah, how do those people get free products for a ""paid review "" on Amazon? I buy a f××k ton of stuff from Amazon."
lxt5qmd,"To my knowledge, they reach out to you. In order to get them to do that... just start posting reviews on things you've bought. videos, photos, long review or short review. Just post a review. The other commenter said the products are junk nowadays. Plus you have to report the product on your taxes."
lxtq9av,"Well, screw that!"
lxr2vaw,Mechanical Turk!  I did this a lot as a postdoc because I made a really low salary despite having a PhD.  I was able to make about $200.
lxrvf9i,200 in how long?
lxs2osj,Over probably a few months.  I know likely wasn’t great return on time but it was nice to have a bit of extra money.
lxszgla,A week or a month?
lxszl3m,Over a couple of months.  I can’t remember exactly it’s been so long.  I made so little money as a postdoc that extra money felt awesome
lxtyeic,Med students suffer unless their parents are comfortable.
lxtyknb,Postdocs aren’t med students.  We have a PhD but are working as a researcher.  My salary then was 41k in 2014.
lxu7q7c,"My bad. I think I knew this... once, lol. I'm 73 and my memory is just super bad lately. That's OK, there's a lot I want to forget!"
lxq7iwd,"MTurk! I did that when I was a stay at home mom.  It was kind of fun, just a bit of extra spending money."
lxqcglp,"Right? Most of it i just idly clicked through, and it was nice to have extra cash when I was a college kid haha"
lxryi07,"I used to hire people like you to e.g., write video game reviews when I was trying to bootstrap UGC websites. It was a great deal on both sides. 

Amazon used to call it ""artificial artificial intelligence"". 😂 (Real name was mechanical Turk/MTurk. The name has sort of an interesting story about an apocryphal chess playing robot.)

BTW if you still want that kind of work now, try DataAnnotation.tech or remotasks."
lxqh3bc,"MTurk helped me buy so many books on Amazon.  I found an awesome, $0.10 to type in info from a business card into forms.  Way easy, and bought so many books!"
lxr9uyb,I did MTurk after I got divorced. Did it in my spare time and earned several thousand dollars a year. It was boring but legit work. It paid for my vacations for a few years.
lxr6ao9,"That was my stepdads first side “job” after getting his work visa.  
He bought my little sister her second car seat with the money he made with it"
lxr8fd2,"Mechanical Turk. I remember doing some of those for hours and it was a lot of ""select all images with a bus"" and I think I topped out at $10 and never did it again."
lxrne8r,"That shit went downhill fast. I joined it a bit late, and the payouts were minuscule to the point of not being worth it at all"
lxs11f4,it is still there and can still earn some side cash on it [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/worker/how-it-works)
lxvh9pg,"It existed well before that, too. In like 2005 they had you look up album art and enter the album title as some sort of seed to get people using it.  The issue was the ASIN was in the album cover URI so you could just extract that and do a quick API lookup to grab the title then fill it. I had that fully automated in like 20 minutes. Even had a watcher on page state to grab the next task, but only for album art. I don’t even think they had captcha at that point. 

That paid for a LOT of fun on Amazon with all the gift cards."
ly2i307,They still do. Except there are not as many tasks anymore.
lxr43g4,Sounds like Mechanical Turk.
lxs4hds,Paid work to train AI models for machine vision! That you for feeding our soon-to-be AI overlords.
lxst0km,"Mechanical Turk still exists. In fact, stuff like that is a lot of the basis for ""AI"" that's not actually AI."
lxst1vr,"Mechanical Turk still exists. In fact, stuff like that is a lot of the basis for ""AI"" that's not actually AI."
lxuc4rw,Mechanical Turk.... that's what it's called
lxvn11r,I used MTurk in college. I would try and make like $100 a week. Sometimes I’d make more. One time I hit the jackpot and landed a $100 turk.
lxq01ju,"During covid I did this exact thing for a site called Swagbucks, really good micro work for beer money, and got 1200 each for me, my wife and 2 friends.  I wouldn't honestly trust it from anywhere else but I had been using this site for some time when this offer became available."
lxq7tu6,"I've been on swagbucks for about 10 years i think...sometimes more active than other times.  I've done a lot of their surveys (I don't anymore) but most recently I've been playing games, that's seemed to pay well. And using the cash back; the last time we traveled i got about 10% back on our hotel stay!"
lxqawbz,Yes what made me the most money was playing the apps that were games and signing up for bank accounts.  Though now the game thing has gotten a little more... intuitive than it was before to complete the requirements to get paid but 100% worth it if you can complete it within the time limit.
lxqkf5f,I recall doing FB games when it was slow at work for Swagbucks and getting like $50 for passing the time playing simulation games in the early days. I honestly thought this is all a scam until I got the payouts.
lxqkawl,I've been on Swagbucks since 2012? I reached the 2nd highest tier at some point which was a $150 reward. I think I used to make like $500/mo off that site when they had all the mobile apps. Swagbucks and Perk paid for the parts of my first gaming pc build 100% in under 6 months.
lxq34kl,"Back in the early 360 era there were those ""Type in the code from a soda bottlecap, chance to win every hour!"" reward programs that seemed like a scam. With a nation/worldwide contest how could you possibly be the winner, or even make sure that the 'winner' was a real person.

Two kids from my grade won working by together for months. They asked for caps from other students for most of the offer period, then one day near the end, super early in the morning, they entered the maximum number of codes per person, each, and probably on multiple accounts. And they kept going for a few hours. And somehow, they both managed to be the winners. One sold theirs, bought a retail copy, and pocketed the scalper fee for games; the other probably still has it since it has it sitting in their garage as a trophy."
lxsksgz,"I got a free iPod this way. I think it was freeipods.com or something. No one at my school could believe it, until they saw the iPod and the T-shirt i got. 

It was one of the first sites. I did it a couple of other times with different sites, and so did my sister. We got about 1k worth of free products."
lxswkrf,"There was one just for housewives that traded grocery store coupons. We were poor, living in the country (there *is* country in California) when I was a single mother. 

I clipped a *ton* of coupons and had them all organized in folders. I used stores' weekly sales items too and my coupons to save money. Then I made my shopping list. 

I am a very detailed person and don't mind the minutiae of things, so I worked hard at it. My shining moment was when I bought two carts full of food worth around $350 dollars, for around $35. For real, I'm not even kidding. In 1985 that was a whole lot more groceries than it is today. Meat heavy!

So those really do exist, but it's a 10-20 hr a week job, and you have to be good at it, if you really want to do it. I did the shopping once a month, and drove my pickup to 3-4 stores to redeem them all. 

Plus downside for today's shoppers, a lot of coupons are now in store only.

Then we moved to the Bay Area, and I went to work for a Fortune 100 investment and retirement planning company, and didn't have to do it any more. Memories. 

There's a lot of simplicity to living poor. It teaches you a lot of things you'll use later in life. Before the lean years were over, I had a vegetable garden that was around 1800 sq ft. I froze all we needed for the winter, and learned how to can tomatoes and a few other things. 


I even won a blue ribbon at the county fair for best salsa. I still have the recipe somewhere,  if anyone wants it, a super good simple one. Lol.

Oh, an FYI: You can get season passes free to any county fair if you have a small minimum number of entries in any exhibits. Have the kids do cute flower arrangements or their own veggies, so they get some passes too. Better parking, free too."
m0ddxpg,"Totally assume most of the ""win a ______"" are a scam.  Interesting to hear that wasn't true.

The $1 trials were good except if you got a bad one that wanted to maintain customer retention.  stamps.com  was one of those back in the early 00's, we got a free trial but it was literally hours on the phone.  100% not worth the free scale.


Also, your post is lacking in math!"
m0dewmr,Did you vote in The Gungies yet?!
m0dfz60,"Huh, did you mention that somewhere?"
m0dhhdg,"[Over 1,000 people have voted so far, why not Zoidberg?](https://forms.gle/zcsJ76eajCJmhPSX7)"
lxppelo,"And now there's an actual X stupid website. Thanks, Elon!"
lxqk2mg,"I built 2 gaming pcs, paid off my couch, bought a ton of tech all from those websites."
lxqvzci,"My wife and I went through some financial hardship and she found some similar sounding website that would basically show you ads and then ask you questions on how you felt about it. 

IT was obviously incredibly low paying even for me who works in IT so can read and click through stuff very fast, but it at least gave us cigarette money (for her, I don't smoke)"
lxrktmn,"Yep, I made a ton of money and got a bunch of free iPods back in the day.  It was a lot of work, though, and I would never recommend doing it to anyone because you really REALLY had to know what you were doing and be quite careful (and track everything) to turn a profit."

lxu6k7d,Not sure when the real ones existed but I fully completed one and got nothing 
lxp7jvr,"I think I got something like 47 dollars from one of these when I was in college. The money was real but it sure was a waste of time. Don’t think I had to download anything. Just remember getting up to 15 cents a day using their search engine, which I would just do repeatedly without looking at results."
lxqy5ph,"Ditto. I got a few bucks using an ""alternative"" search engine (made it my default and every time I searched something, I could always re-search with google if I got crap results) and filling out a few surveys.

I wouldn't call them 'scams' (because they do pay out) so much as ""not worth the time"""
lxq0lsy,"Yeah, if no money was given, it couldn’t go far. This is the usual scheme: give money for more money"
lxp4fbp,"Plenty actually pay out. Some are scams. Had to file a 1099 a couple of years ago because I made thousands off of one of them.

Source: currently clean drug addict"
lxpg4z0,"Do you remember which ones actually paid out, specifically the one you made the most from? Please and thank you!"
lxpvbpq,"The way the legit apps work is you earn credits on the app that you can then turn in for gift cards to amazon, target, etc. The two apps I've used are YouGov and Swagbucks. 

YouGov is a survey site that will give you credits for taking surveys. They only offer a couple of surveys for you to take a week, so it isn't a reliable source of extra change. I've been using it a year and have made enough credits for $125. 

IIRC Swagbucks offers more ways to earn credits and there is always an opportunity to do so. They do surveys and daily ""tasks"". Their main draw though is that they offer ""challenges"" for reaching certain checkpoints in mobile games in a certain amount of days. But these are the shittiest, most annoying, ad-ridden mobile games ever. The whole schtick is that it is nearly impossible to reach the checkpoint in time without paying to win or paying to remove ads, so they hope you end up paying for things and then giving up out of boredom before they have to pay out rewards to you. I did this for a few weeks and earned $50, but man I hated those weeks lol. Many better ways to waste my time.

Edit: I wanted to add that I actually enjoy using YouGov and that I view the Swagbucks games as scam-adjacent."
lxqkq95,FWIW YouGov is a legit site but it took me a year to cash out $100 so it's the literal slowest way to earn. It used to be a good way to make some holiday money for me for a while though. Start towards the end of the year and by next Christmas you can have $100 to spend on basically a few little things.
lxt01mc,"Swagbucks also has a quasi-Fetch-like system where if you buy certain groceries from certain brands or subscriptions you get points. 

Some of the email subscriptions were dumb and you could use a fake email generator to farm the points."
lxq9lzs,"When I was unemployed, Swagbucks got me through a few rough months. I had most luck with the various casino ones.  I feel like some of them didn't run off real world odds where the customer always loses because it builds up to quadrillions of credits in some of them, but you basically just have to get jackpots, but once you get a decent backroll you can do most of them pretty easily.  Some of the typical mobile games were decent too, as long as you read the fine print.  Evony, whatever survival, puzzle blah blah, mostly the same shit, and usually the trick is to just join a clan.  People have also done write ups on how to optimize some of them, but usually it's like buying a $20 pack to get $70 reward, but you have to be careful to not mess up the requirements and get denied by support.   Then there's the various time trial games where you basically have to play as a full time job for a week to earn $30, using almost every last energy point to make it, maybe with 10% to spare.  The time-play games aren't generally too bad if you can get ones that pay more than a penny per minute, and not just downloading a game that feeds ads to you every minute for pennies an hour."
lxq3x8h,"Not the original commenter, and not thousands, but I've successfully cashed out about $250 in Walmart and Amazon giftcards through Mistplay. 

I don't think the Paypal option works based on reviews, but I've had great luck with the gift cards. I get about $50/month without trying too hard. When I was unemployed I was getting more. If you enjoy taptap games it's a fine way to waste time."
lxqkktj,r/beermoney still exists. It's more work now for less money. I quit officially doing things in 2023 though. My best year was over $10K in money and gift cards. You have to report anything over $600 in cash now and I ain't about that life. I never reported the income.
lxr6mi5,"Having to report anything over $600 to the IRS has been true for decades, at least."
lxr7u60,"Actually you're supposed to report any amount you make even if it's 10 cents. It's just that the services like Paypal had a ceiling that was massive and the covid bill put in a rider that Paypal, Venmo et all now report you to the IRS if you earn more than $600. It was supposed to go into effect last year, hurting small business owners and other people who use electronic payments, and the ceiling was lowered to $600 if you use Goods and Services. People gonna find out the hard way this year when it goes into effect but they could lower that to ANY amount as you're supposed to report every single cent you ""earn"" so the IRS gets their pound of flesh off you."
lxqmj4q,Crowdtap and Prolific pay out. Prolific is an actual research site where you get paid by researchers to do the studies. Crowdtap is surveys. I can earn $5-10 gift cards a week.
lxs3wdp,"Every one of them I've actually used, paid out.

The problem was, like OP said, you're working for well, well, below min. wage, and the payout is rarely in the form of actual cash.

I got a lot of magazine subs back in the day for filling out surveys.  And a decent amount of Amazon gift cards as well.  

I was going to be wasting my time on the internet anyways, might as well waste some of it making a lil bit of money.

And honestly, if there was a site like that that paid even $5/hr now, in actual cash (or maybe even wmart gift cards) I'd probably waste a lot of time on it too."
lxsh7fj,Pogo and Reward Play on this one you complete 2 of 3 task every other day and you'll score a $5 gift card. If you do the task you don't have to mess around with the games except for downloading a new one every other day but then you don't really have to use it since they're used counter isn't working right now and hasn't worked for over a month. But I still get the task done and still get my $5 gift card. I rack up quite a few

lxqny1x,"Swagbucks, freecash, and drumo for the games and sketchy apps. 

Surveyjunkie and PrimeOpinion for surveys. 

I've tried a lot of them, these are definitely the best ones I've found."
lxr3lbo,"I haven't used it in a few years, but Quick Thoughts used to be good. It was a flat $1 per survey no matter the length, and some were really quick ""watch an ad and tell us what you think of it"". It paid in Amazon gift cards, which I then used to buy Google Play gift cards to fund my Love Nikki addiction lol. I probably made ~$15/ week just checking it casually."
lxrp1mw,I used to crush it on quick thoughts. I averaged $10/day for a year or two only doing surveys on public transit to work. Paid for an entire Airbnb vacation from it. Then they made it almost impossible to make anything off of it and I haven’t used it in 2 years.
lxr13u4,The sites dont work in Bangalore....
lxqtl9g,"Yeah I made a couple thousand off Swagbucks just playing games and doing a few sign up offers. 

However, I had a work from home job that required me to be on, but not actively doing a ton for a lot of the time, so it was nice for that type of situation. I wouldn't have done it with actual free time."
lysxuxh,"I like that you said currently clean instead of recovering.

This makes me feel better about being a drug attic.   Recovering implies something is lost or missing instead of just a little dirty."

I like the way you think of it also, though. Good luck brother."
lxppn41,"I got hit up by some guy selling this shit about a year ago.

I downloaded the software and got started with his instruction. Basically you would get offered some money and accept it then press a button 10 times or something and the money would be credited to your account. I kept going trying to work out where the scam was going to come from when one of the offers was a 'bonus' that pays twice as much but you have to pay in first to unlock it. 'Ahhhh' I thought, there it is.. The guy put the money in my account as he said it was the first one and he would pay it this time, i completed the tasks and got the money in the account.

I still don't really understand it completely but I'm assuming that it's going to ask you to drop like $200 to unlock a reward and then fuck you. I never went that far. I cashed out after his 'tutorial' and got about 70 usdt for about half an hour pressing buttons."
lxp83q3,"I remember when I was a kid and a lot of browser games offered exactly this in exchange for the game's premium currency...in hindsight, what an awful thing to do in games targeted towards children. Of course the largest offers were the ones that made you install random fucking applications on your parent's computer."
lxqyn9l,"They aren't really scams, but you just don't make enough money for it to be really worth it.  I've made probably like $20 from a couple sites I found on r/beermoney"
lxpnytx,"You could go mow someone's lawn or watch someone's kid and make more than that in less time... that's what makes them a scam. 

Its not that none of them pay out - some of them definitely do. It's the time required to receive any benefits."
lxq1sms,"I wouldn’t consider GPT sites as a scam but obviously they’re not worth doing unless you live in a third world country but most surveys and offer won’t apply to you. 

I currently do something similar and it only earns $1 to 2 USD per day in Bitcoin for about 5 minutes of “work”. I won’t say what it is though because I’m not looking for competition. It’s not much money but It’s a pretty sweet deal considering for some services/subscriptions I don’t feel comfortable using a credit card and how do I get crypto that’s not linked to being purchased using my information either without going to a Bitcoin ATM and depositing cash? Real-Debrid is one of them."
lxqrj1s,My retired father makes tens of dollars a month doing hundreds of online surveys. Gives him something to do I guess.
lxqwazp,Kinda the same for pay-to-play games. They will get people for $300 by having them buy shit $9.99 at a time.
lxrexys,"I've actually bought my outdoor furniture (2 Adirondack chairs, an end table, and a fire globe) and the wood stain I used on them through one of those sites. The return rate is nowhere near what I'd make with an actual part time job, but then I couldn't do one of those in my underwear when I have an extra 15 minutes of free time before going to bed."
lxs7yll,The fact that soooooo many of those sites and apps do sponsorships with youtubers that may have a lot of children in their fan base is disgusting to me.
lxsgw1d,"Same with survey sites. You get 50% through only to be kicked out for ""not combatable""."

I'm disabled and my gf works, so I'm at home most of the time and I get bored. Being low income means I can't afford many luxuries, and I enjoy those little toys Mini Brands. So I have my game money on my PayPal and that's what I use for my goofy little toys.

So sure, it's a scam, but it's worth doing for some."
lxr3g9u,"I fell for that crap when I was in college. I did all these surveys, transcriptions, and odd jobs and in the end, I was given a $25 gift card for over a month of work. I gave up quickly after that.

I never downloaded anything nor used special search engines, but that sure sounds like a privacy concern!"
lxr9lit,"Hey man some were legit back in the day. Some.

That’s how I got like $20 in credit to buy new characters for Facebook games in like 2013 lmao. Can’t believe some surveys actually worked and I got in game currency.

FWIW it was also on a burner FB account with a burner email and no personal info tied to that account."
lxrfuvi,I definitely fell for one on the basis that it was an app advertising money for surveys and there were no real popup ads in app. Worked great for the first cashout but I eventually noticed a lot more surveys became suddenly cancelled for 'too many participants'. I later realised I was spending way too much time doing multiple minute surveys for cents of a dollar.
lxrioun,Google opinions?
lxrj3ix,"My mother in law has been taking pictures of all her paper receipts for TWO YEARS and inputting them into some app. She told me proudly she's half of the way there to a $25 Amazon gift card. 

How the fuck is this worth the time?! Not to mention, do you really want to give some random app a record of everything you buy?

But she wants that gift card, so..."
lxrsdb6,Facebook is currently inundating me with ads telling me that I can make money by reviewing products. The comment sections on these posts are flooded with folks asking for more information. The few of us who realize it's a scam of some sort can't get through the noise.
lxrwi5k,"I used to do one of those when I was 12 or 13.  I was probably making something like 10-15 cents an hour, but at the time I thought it was the only way I could make money that I could spend on the internet.

Then one day, at the bank, the teller said something along the lines of ""oh, your checking account doesn't have an ATM card yet, let me fix that"".  And I was confused and asked why it looked like a credit card.  When she told me that it was also a debit card, and I could use it anywhere credit cards were accepted, my mind was completely blown.  I could now actually spend my allowance on what I wanted."
lxrxuep,"Truth. But way, way back in the day you could get Bitcoin for watching YT videos to inflate the view counts and make them ""go viral"". Sort of like when publishers buy their own books to make them hit the NYT bestseller list. One company was called virool. 

Of course back then BTC was worth like <$1 so this gig paid pennies per hour. I hope some random people did it anyway and got rich though."
lxrz39g,"You know what's crazy about this? Around 10 years ago now I signed up for something like this, except you were supposed to be sharing expertise. I just ended up filling in surveys for $1 worth of crypto at a time. Surveys dried up after earning $30 worth of crypto (Bitcoin), and I was yeah right, I'm never getting this money out of here. Low and behold, I was able to transfer the balance to a legitimate wallet, which shortly after the election is worth $800. I've never touched it, and just check in on the balance one a year or something.

But obviously, everything since has become a scam. I've never seen anything like this again."
lxrza2g,Those are successful because they have dozens of ones that actually do give you what you want after 1 or 2 steps . I used to fall for these scams all the time and it’s entirely because they stack smaller prizes that you can actually achieve in a few steps which are fully valid .  This convinces you to go after a bigger prize which takes all the work only to not be there
lxs01u4,"Does anyone else remember a company called AllAdvantage? They had a toolbar you would run with your internet browser that would display rotating ads at the bottom/top of your window while you were connected to the internet (on dialup in 1999/2000). Considering how little time I spent online, it was a bit of a goldmine for a 15 year old kid. I got a few $25 checks from them.

They apparently only lasted for 2 years. Wow."
lxs4mop,"Some online games in the 00's used to do this in exchange for the paid currency. Finishing surveys, watching ads, downloading apps, etc. They paid a pittance for essentially your personal data but 10 year old me was just happy to receive 3 Dragon Coins or 20 NX lmfao."
lxsa13t,"I've gotten a few hundred dollars doing these, but the time sink became too unmanageable. Too often, you'd complete most of a survey only to discover that you hadn't qualified for the reward. I'm sure the survey company kept the answers anyway, basically getting my information for free. I had to stop doing it."
lxsc70e,"I remember being 13 and falling for something that was obviously a scam.

it was a ""steam account money adder"" where you typed in your steam username, watched an ad and apparently your steam account would get money.

I watched several ads before realizing, ""wait a minute this is a scam""

it was basically an ad-watcher installed on my desktop.

luckily it was harmless and didnt give my PC a virus nor did it compromise my steam account, as it didn't ask for my password. if it HAD asked for my password, I would've KNOWN it was a scam."

lxt8b5h,"An old buddy scammed the fuck out of one of those companies - Swagg Bucks or Bux or somethin. 

He made some bots or whatever and made it seem like dozens of people were using the site as intended but they were all his bots while he slept n shit and he made several thousand dollars off the site before someone working there patched the vulnerability he was abusing and everything stopped working. 

He tried a few times to get it goin again but it never lasted long after that first couple months and the accounts started getting banned too quickly to cashout and such and eventually he gave up on it."
lxtb7xr,"I've actually gotten a decent payout from one of these. I do have a couple of rules that I follow though: I never spend my own money on any of the apps/games, never allow permissions beyond those required to run the apps (so no third-party tracking if I can avoid it), and if I'm linking the games to Facebook for bonus points, I'm linking them to my secondary FB account which I only ever use for games (it's under a pseudonym and doesn't have any ""likes"" or ""friends"" so there's no data there to steal)."

lxw7vjr,"Now what’s popping up on tiktok and Instagram are slideshows set up like “things I learned while working at Crumbl” or “what I learned while living in Japan” then the last slide would be “they don’t want you to know that you could do these surveys for $500 SHEIN gift card”. I try to report them and put a comment there to warn gullible people but my report either gets dismissed or my comment deleted. If it sounds too good to be true, then it is. No one is that generous for a questionnaire. I feel bad too because a lot of those slideshows steal photos from random people’s personal accounts so when they do get in trouble for the scam the angry mob would attack a random rather than the true perpetrator.  I had a bank manager tell me too that those links would sprinkle in some personal questions like “what’s your average income?” “your zip code?” “Age?” so they can sell it and worse case you get identity theft and someone trying to access your accounts. Avoid those links at all costs!"

When they opened in France, she was among the first ones and she made a killing. She bought an apartment cash in less than 3 years.

I told them “The power company DOES. NOT. CALL. AND DEMAND. VISA CARDS. If they want you to settle your account on a Saturday afternoon let’s drive to the office and give them cash. Please put down the gift cards.”

It’s not that I’m smarter than them. I just wasn’t strung along into a panic like they had been."
lxps51e,"My GF called me in tears because some scammer was threatening her that there was an arrest warrant out for her and she needed to provide info right now (pay a fine or something) and the warrant could be stopped. 

After a few minutes of getting details from her I told her to just hang up.

They fucking wrecked her.  If I could find that person... well... nuff said."
lxpzsub,"This really infuriates me. People who don’t have any interaction with law enforcement don’t understand that the cops don’t call you up to make sure that you are ready for them before they come over to arrest you. And you don’t pay a fine to a cop or an officer of the court over the phone. 
A really evil variation of this scam is that the scammer will call the cops and request a wellness check for the person at the house, so that the cops do show up."
lxrggu2,"this is how the police operate in a lot of countries though so im not surprised if this scam would be very successful against immigrants.

the one, literally ONE decent thing about American policing is that its not as systemically overrun with bribery like it is in a lot of other places. because they dont need to take bribes. They can just steal from the taxpayers with phony overtime :D"
lxrnflp,"they almost got my grandma when she was in her late 90s , she tries to convince us to take her to the atm so she could meet the guy that was going to invest her money in lottery tickets. It was really sad, just knowing how serious she was, it had been going on for some time and my family was monitoring it closely, but that was the final straw where someone legitimately had a meeting spot and everything"
lxrye4j,"Ooh, poor gran!"
lxt49fx,"Yea 💔 it led to us having to take away her cell phone and hide her mail. It caused a lot of distress to her, but they were hitting her from all angles, and her mental state was very slowly starting to degrade at that time. I actually think she got some checks out, which is what alerted the family member who was helping that something was up. Then it became obvious how obsessed with checking her mail and missing phone callls bc she had won. It was really sad to bear witness to, not even bc she was a close loved one but just how vulnerable elderly populations can be. And how sneaky it was bc we have a decent amount of family who was with her daily and very much apart of her life everyday. Once we knew what was up, I saw it coming from every angle of communication. None of us were looking for it or expecting that people were aiming to scam her, so it was missed initially… but once clued in, we all felt pretty dumb for missing the signs."
lxty5v8,"Well, you could buy her a little gift, like a shawl or something,  and wrap it.

""Oh, gran! Looks like you won something after all!"""
lxu4zkr,"that’s a sweet thought and very creative, definitely something to keep in mind for others going thru this 🩷 she passed away at 101. She lived a long happy life surrounded by lots of kids grandkids and great grandkids… she even fell in love and got married again at 80!

Her mentation took a turn very late 90s, I want to say 97 is when it got a lot worse, but she was pleasantly demented (for many this is not the case, it can be terrifying confusing and awful for all) - she always believed her first husband would be coming home shortly from work - he had been passed away for nearly 40 yrs at that point. I want to say the scams happened when she was 95ish. 

It’s been 4 years since her passing. I appreciate the kind thought ❤️"

lxsp7ql,"I used to get these. I drag it out enough (I love wasting any phone scammer's time) to get more solid info on their location or good leads. That way I can report it to actual detectives and shut it down.

lxsg3on,Well it actually gets worse because there is a huge vulnerability in SS7 that no one really talks about. It basically let's you take over someone's phone number and it is not really spoofing it is taking control of the phone number. Veritasium did a Youtube video about a month ago Exposing The Flaw in Our Phone System. The problem is no one wants to be first one to take the first step to move to the more secure system.

lxrceix,"This happened to my little sister. She’s a nurse so an arrest would cost her literally her career. She panicked and payed the person almost $5k. Luckily she got it all back. But that’s not the point. I was quite shocked because my sister is incredibly intelligent. Not just book smart, I couldn’t believe she fell for it. When I asked her ultimately what had her convinced it was real, she told me when they called it came up as the local sheriffs department on her phone, at one point she hung up the phone, went to google and called them directly. When she did the scammers picked up."

lxqeje1,They tried this on me while I was at my office at the agency they were pretending to be calling from.

I get they’re mostly from places where its one of the rare ways to make a good wage that isn’t physically dangerous.

lxqm8xk,"> I actually think the people that work in these scam call centers are some of the lowest people on earth.

In multiple ways, by design.

I wish more ethical hackers took it upon themselves to destroy those people (especially the ones actually organizing the operations).

Lady was even doing that weird forced laugh that crazy people do. 

She kept calling me off and on for about a week but apparently from her own phone number. Caller ID had the same number every time, so I would know it was her, I'd just pick up and hang up (this was in the cordless phone age) before I heard a word. I also filed a police report. She kept calling until I finally told her I'd filed a police report and asked her if she wanted the report number.

lxrm3td,"Yeah they operate on the fear and high pressure. 

I remember my dad got a call from ""Me"" that ""I"" was in a car ran over a person and the idea of the scam is that cops would come and were ready to let it slide for a bribe

They didn't know I was at home sleeping lol

So he started giving me instructions on how to dispose of the body. He was like ""Where are you? I can come help - No I'm far away in the woods or something like that - ok, then make sure he's dead and run, we'll ask Uncle Vano to hide you in Armenia until it settles, go now, I'll deal with the body"""
lxrmwp3,"this exact same thing happened to me… the kicker was the call actually came from a general courthouse #. I usually just hang up, but they caught me at an odd moment and it just felt super real. I was in tears saying there’s no way this could be the case, I’ve never been been served any papers… once they told me to meet at the courthouse with a check I came to my senses. 

I don’t know how I fell for that one, but on the phone I googled the # and it was for the la courthouse and I was wracking my brain thinking I missed a ticket and it turned into something crazy.

He had to pay in Amazon gift cards, which are maxed at $500 each and most stores only sell 4 at a time to the same person. Not only did I and everyone in the store tell him it was FAKE, but he was eventually blacklisted from local stores for buying too many gift cards. He started traveling further and further for the gift cards, and he finally got the $12,000 total, 24 gift cards and he had to take pics of all of them and send them to the Escalade seller on Amazon. He was beaming, calling us dumb because his Escalade would be delivered to his home the next morning, that we were all jealous haters. He missed a few days of work after that and when he came back he told us if anyone mentioned the Escalade we’d get fired.

And I'm no scammer or energy expert, so add in all the lingo/personal information you want to add credibility.

We had a data partner who was only able to accept paperwork via fax. I tried to reach someone about it but could only get to their product manager, who wouldn't let me speak to their devs, and they were very insistent that they didn't have the engineering resources to set up a drop box, CDN, or API. Something something data security, something something allocation of manpower, something something compliance.

SO - I did what I could, built up a system that would generate PDF files from our modernized data stack, and forward them digitally into some BS enterprise service that would fax the digital documents. It took around a month to fully build, test, and deploy but it at least saved a ton of time and resources.

Six months later I happened to be at THEIR offices and someone mentioned in passing that it was crazy that they had an API architect here (me) for this project, but that our company was still ""insistent"" on sending faxes for the other project. 

It turns out that on THEIR end, they had purchased some enterprise service to digitally accept and decode faxes into digital data, which they had automated import for, and that had taken THEM two months to build as well.

So on my end, I was taking the raw data they needed, generating documents programmatically with all the letterhead and boilerplate and shit, and then translating it into a third party service to securely send them, and then on the other end they were digitally reading in the fake faxes, stripping out all of the boilerplate and formatting, and translating it right back into the raw digital data.

All this because some middle management needed to justify their job and wouldn't let the software people just speak directly."
lxsspir,"Fax numbers are still big in law and medicine. Almost everywhere has e-fax services now to bridge the gap. Some places don't like e-signatures like DocuSign so that leaves fax and courier.

Basically it's still kicking because of older gens not trusting e-sign, but somehow trusting fax."

lxq3iea,"The typos are a filter, a feature not a bug"
lxrft43,I heard a theory that scammers purposefully put in typos to identify those who aren’t paying attention to details or who may be more easily susceptible to scams.
lxq2rzn,There’s still spammers using faxes?!
lxpfs4q,"Our IT has our entire company do bi-annual (twice per year) phishing training to identify scam emails. 

Some of them are very convincing."
lxq6lkz,"As they should be.

Making sure people don't fall for very obvious scam's is nice but there are actual dangerous threat actors out there who do proper research and use very convincing methods like finding out the date when salaries are paid out so that they can send an alert the day before warning that there was an issue and it needs to be solved by end of day or you'll get this months salary next pay cycle. 

Or if they're really good they track a specific high level manager, figure out when they're on a plane by tracking them on social media and send a malicious attachment ""from them"" while they can't be reached, pointing this out in the mail: ""Hey it's John, I'm on Terry's phone, phone's dead and we're boarding but I forget to send you this spreadsheet. It's for Mike, check the numbers and if they look good forward them to him. Tell him I'll be in touch when we get to Tampa""

Enough information will bypass most people's suspicion centers. There's so much publicly available data out there it's trivial to sound like you actually work somewhere so people need to be trained to follow procedures to the letter, no exceptions."
lxqccry,"This company I worked for would send out fake scam emails a few times a year, and then keep track of who properly reported them, who clicked the link in them, or who did nothing.

On one occasion however, one of the fake emails they sent was regarding a bonus all the employees were getting….needless to say some people were upset. A few hours later the head of IT of the whole company then sent out a company-wide email apologizing, stating that sending a fake bonus email was probably in poor taste."
lxrfqyf,"I craft these scam Emails for fun sometimes. (for testing employees - not real scamming)

I had one with like a 50% click rate that was from ""Shirley Suiter"" (someone who doesn't work in our business) with a subject line ""You just WON an [company name] Mystery Box!""

The body was ""Hello, you have just been randomly selected to win a [company name] mystery box! Please click the link below to claim your prize!

Congratulations!

I saw it as a scam due to the domain the email came from, but I some people really fell for it, being post COVID and nearly Xmas.

From then on everything from the company i forwarded straight to the phishing email"
lxsq0d3,"Yep, IT guy here.  We have our system randomly send out phishing emails on a daily basis.  The same folks fall for it every time.  For some reason people cannot keep themselves from clicking on every damn link and responding to every email they get - it's like a sickness."
ly5ds5g,"The really annoying ones are the ones I click because it’s literally sent from IT’s email address- then I have to do extra training because I “fell for it” and shouldn’t open links from unknown email addresses, except I opened it because it wasn’t unknown… 🤦🏻‍♀️"
lxpj94n,"We had a local coffee shop get scammed, a caller from the “FBI” convinced the assistant manager that their cash was counterfeit and she needed to take it all and go buy gift cards. It was about $700 and she was fired, probably worth it to the store owner to find out that they had hired a fucking moron."
lxptmyo,Read that twice because I thought I must have missed something the first time. 
lxq4yoe,"Ah yes. You are in possession of counterfeit currency. We're just going to have you put it back into circulation. No Biggie, go buy some gift cards 🤡 It always comes back to fucking gift cards 🤣"

I was 18 and was newly a manager, and was so terrified because they were threatening me with arrest.

lxvcbds,Valid. I just remember a lot of talk about the possibility at the time.
ly5ee9g,"Plus if the company reimbursed her, now they’re incentivizing other people to go out and buy gift cards then claim to have been scammed so they can keep the free gift cards for themselves."
lxr9tas,"It is hard to believe someone could fall for the ""gift card for CEO"" emails. WTF? How could someone be so gullible?"
lxvbrmr,"Yeah, she quit really soon after. I think she was embarrassed. In her defense, the CEO can be demanding at times and there's an air of ""when he says jump, start jumping"" around the place."

lxs3vy2,"Doesn't help in most cases. As long as the card holder authorizes the charges they won’t do anything, it’s not covered under their regular identity theft fraud protection."
lxvdcjd,I wasn't sure but thought it would be a free call to find out.
lxvdion,"Aw, damn. Sorry that happened. And sorry it seems like the card companies might not be much help. I wasn't sure."
lxr6oli,Proof point and other companies do phishing email training with simulated phishing emails. Those simulated phishing emails trigger a lot of retraining. But that hopefully reduces actual scam success
lxvc457,"Yep. KnowBe4 is another one, and Fintech, I think. Our MSP contract includes the service and we're starting it soon. This incident happened years ago, so we're right on track. ;)"

lxsvi8v,"I’m the evil HR lady, and I got one of the direct deposit scam emails! Didn’t realize it was a scam until like a week later, and very fortunately for the company, I have a severe case of “not my job/self service means SERVE YOUR SELF” and just told the CEO to change it in our HRIS."

lxqktap,"I also have seen a female Marketing Manager get caught up in this, but at a former role and we both since moved on.

No reimbursement either! (Why would they?)"

lxpt8h1,[deleted]
lxqkxnt,"That policy is stupid as fuck, since the store gets left with the bill in the event of a chargeback."
lxrtn65,"Bank wont do chargebacks. Chargebacks are for if either they A: Didn't authorize the purchase, such as card being stolen. Or B: The merchant did not provide the good/service. I.e. fraudulent billing. They don't cover buyers remorse. 

If the card holder knowingly made the purchase and the merchant provided it, i.e. the gift card is functional, then the bank will dust their hands and say you shouldn't have bought it then."
lxs0g0i,"Unfortunately, as a retail store owner, customers absolutely file fraudulent chargebacks. Our margin on gift cards is basically nothing so we have to foot everything. 

That’s why I have my employees quiz people on why they’re getting the gift cards. (But make it sound like friendly conversation)"
lxqnq7g,"Truly, thank you. I work in finance with the elderly with dementia and the ones who are all alone have no one to stop them. It’s so so sad and awful. We froze this clients accounts to prevent her from taking all her money out to give it all away to scammers, which is what we caught on she was doing. She went behind our backs and took out a second$30k mortgage on her already paid off house.  She gave it all away to some creep online. We couldn’t stop her from doing that. I was devastated."
lxraukz,"Oh, that poor woman. You tried. Scammers are awful"
lxq0puk,My boss went to jail and within 24 hours someone tried to scam my manager with one of these. Saying they could pay his bail with giftcards...lmao
lxql1it,I just love the thought of someone trying to get out of prison by trying to pay whoever it is a £100 of Amazon cards.
lxs01zd,"Where those scammers are from, that's actually how it goes."
lxqrhm0,"I’ve seen a few stores with a sign near the cashier, warning about scammers and gift cards.  It’s so sad.  I’ve heard the stories of how some folks dig their heels in and insist that they know what they are doing, when the IRS is demanding iTunes gift cards to cover their taxes 🙄"
lxr1t3c,"When I had to work cashier for a small bit at a store, they trained us to be on the lookout for people buying a ton of gift cards and to ask questions for this reason."
lxrv6m1,"I've never had any people being scammed for gift cards, only scammers themselves. Common one was the damaged reloadable gift card. Card actually has a balance of $0 on it. Swipe, gives error because card is damaged and cant be read, manager can override to approve the purchase. Then it then tries to bill the card at end of closing day, the card is a balance of $0 and charge fails. But that's hours after the customer has walked away with hundreds of dollars in purchases, often gift cards (bought with the fake gift card).

I've trained every employee I've ever worked with about this scam and some of them STILL fall for it. Like, buying $200 in giftcards...with a visa gift card, should be all kinds of red flags straight out of the gate."
lxrx0y6,"> I've trained every employee I've ever worked with about this scam and some of them STILL fall for it. Like, buying $200 in giftcards...with a visa gift card, should be all kinds of red flags straight out of the gate.

Ironically I knew a guy who does this and got stopped at a Walgreens one day. He would go out and buy a few $100 apple gift cards, because he was playing a mobile p2w MMO game and would gift women whom he was ""dating"" in the game those gift cards."
lxqzavp,My SIL got a call that she had to pay her taxes ASAP or she couldn't receive her disability check?  I can't remember the details but when she was at the store buying gift cards the cashier questioned her and explained how it was a scam. That cashier saved her money.
lxq8ygz,I wish you were there for me when this happened to me 😞
lxr9s19,"Thank you for that. Guy at Mejier did that when my 80 yr old MIL got scammed. We really appreciated him stepping in, appreciate you!"
lxpwizn,"Yep, the employee at my job who fell for it did, indeed, buy $2K worth of gift cards at Walgreens."
lxqkuzb,You were doing Gods work. Good on you.
lxr0ici,"Thank you! My husband's aunt was scammed several months ago. The people at her bank told her she was being scammed and tried to stop her. She got angry with them and shut down her account, then opened a new account elsewhere and lost $9,000 as a result. The first bank told my husband they do not want her back."
lxrbbtj,So frustrating
lxre1ar,"What's sad is the reason people keep falling for gift card scams is because they think they're being ""safer"" because they're not giving their direct banking info to people over the phone. That alone is enough to convince any old person that it's not a scam. It's sad as fuck."
lxr5vn3,"Good on you. A couple years ago my wallet was stolen and they racked up $4k in gift cards within 15 minutes using my credit cards. Luckily it was flagged as fraud so I didn’t pay a dime, but how were the employees not immediately suspicious?"
lxrsa2p,That was kind of you to do Snake.   Did Walgreens reward you for protecting innocent victims?   You’re an “everyday hero”.
lxs3pg1,"You are a good guy, I am glad you helped those people and had the foresight to just ask a simple question."

lyqdyou,"$40,000 in gift cards?!? JFC."
lyy8702,"JFC. Yes. And yes, I thought "" who could be so dumb to do that?"""
lxw4yx1,Real mvp
lxpdjza,"Closest I got to falling for this one: scammer called my work and said he works for (distributor) and there were expired gift cards we need to pull from the shelves. I was extremely suspicious because I work night shift and it was 11pm and we don't usually have anyone come in or do Official Business on third shift. I told him we didn't do business over the phone, got the spiel of this is normal and how we operate, etc. I said okay.

He told me which gift cards to pull from the rack, then told me to grab the first one and get a sharpie, then told me to write some nonsense number code on the back. And then, the real shit: he told me ""alright, now scratch the silver bar and tell me the serial number underneath""

I'm not THAT dumb so I let him no "", I'm not doing that. We don't give out gift cards over the phone"". He argued, and I hung up finally. 

I'm not dumb, I just have severe anxiety and didn't want to do something wrong if this was real. I told myself if he asks for the actual code, I'll know it's 100% a scam. 

Fuck those people. They're predators, plain and simple."
lxq525h,"Shit like this can easily happen. I was going through my emails early one morning and I get an email allegedly from the Tax Office about a refund. Thing is, my accountant told me to expect a refund so I assumed that this was it. It wasn't until they asked for the pin to my bank account that I suddenly woke up and realised that it was a scam."
lxptzio,"Even if you gave him the numbers, it wouldn’t work unless scanned and activated at the register"
lxq08m2,"Yeah that's what I figured. I don't do gift cards on my shift at all, so I've never actually activated one, but I know they need to be activated. I assume the next part of the scam would involve activating them in some way."
lxrn69u,"Once they have the card number and pin, they can run an automated script to check the balance on a website every couple of hours, and notify them if the balance goes above $0.00

Once someone else actually purchases and activates the card (any random customer walking into the store looking for a legit gift card) the scammers will steal the money off of it."
lxrp5h2,"Well no, since the scratched gift cards won't be sold"
lxq1b07,They have some kind of system that notifies them when the card is activated.
lxqrc2o,I Would have given him fake number after rubbing a penny across some random furniture to get the sound of scratching the bar off.  Let the scammer waste time trying to use fake code
ly2sqnl,It's serve them right.
lxquzx6,"Wouldn't it have needed to be activated first anyway? You can't just steal gift cards from a store, right?"
lxqz5it,"my assumption is that the next phase of the scam would involve activating them in some way, but we didnt get that far!"
lxr7d8t,The scammer was trying to be smart but not going in the natural order of activating a gift card. Actually activating it likely would've been the next step. Slightly out of order stuff can really trip some people up
lxrwne7,"From what another poster said, they just write down the serials and pin and setup a script to check the balance of that card every hour or so. Prepaid cards usually have this on their website to check the balance, wouldn't be hard to automate it to go down a list. Once someone DOES activate the card legitimately, they now have the number and pin and can do purchases with it."
lxrg868,"So I always assumed gift cards had to be scanned at the register to be ""activated"" and then you use the code? 

Can you really just walk into Walgreens, scratch the code, take a picture with your phone and go use it online?"
lxrr79r,"No, you assumed correctly. These cards have no value until activated/funded. 

They might have tried to convince u\/meat_uprising to add funds to the card after they got the code, just to mix things up a bit. 

Or they might have wanted u\/meat_uprising to return the card to the rack hoping that someone would buy it in the future (without realizing that the code was already visible)."
lxrw2vo,It 11 at night I'd have fun with it and read them random numbers. Let them get frustrated that the cards aren't working while insisting that is indeed what the card says. See how long you can string them along thinking they've got a bite and instead waste their time and energy.
lxs2eg5,"I always told myself that's what I'd do if I encountered a scammer. I watch Kitboga religiously! But in the moment, it is so stressful and scary in a way I didn't expect. It's easy to say what you'd do when you're not in the situation, but.. in the situation itself, everything is so much different. That's *why* scams work, IMO."
lxqqnxu,"Yes,  you are correct, they are.  I wouldn't even class them as humans.  They are evil, nasty, spawned from the devil and hell.

Why do I give a shit? It's funny to point out hypocrisy."
lxsfz6t,"I didn't type kn. I meant to type 'told him ""no, I'm not doing that, \[etc\]'

I accidentally dragged 'no ' to before the quotation, because my phone lets me drag words around. Just thought saying it's autocorrect makes it more clear that it's a mistake, rather than go into intricate detail about some shit that doesn't matter.

lxpe80e,Fell for it WITH the NFP's funds? Surely you mean ex-coworker?!
lxrxxt7,They did move on not long after this lol. They used their company issued credit card to purchase the gift cards. The scammer impersonated our CEO and said it was last minute for an event. We provide gift cards to community members for some of our programs so that probably primed them to fall for it - but it wasn't even a particularly good scam email. Lots of very loud yelling behind closed  office doors occurred.
lxt20t0,"I know someone who ended up in (somewhat) the reverse situation. They worked for a tiny nonprofit, and *the CEO* got an email claiming to be from them and to change their direct deposit details. Which he promptly did, and sent like six weeks worth of their salary to some scammer. 

He, not surprisingly, did not get fired."
ly5eysf,"And then the nonprofit paid the employee appropriately afterward, right? Because even if the company gets scammed, it’s still wage theft if you take it out on the employee."
ly5g9kb,"Oh, yes. That was not an issue; as soon as they brought it up, the CEO straightened it out and sent them their money correctly. It was just, you know, thousands had gone to someone else by that point. Thousands the nonprofit didn't really have to be throwing away."
lxpejz8,"Yeah, WTH."
lxpezo2,I want to see their resume.. lol Must be hot stuff.

lxq2cqo,"30 credits is definitely odd, but not impossible. The secretary in one of my university's departments liked to tell the story about a woman who essentially did 2x overload every quarter because of some life event, but that's still odd and the exception.

lxpim9k,"For anyone who sees this and thinks it might be fun to do, and it can be (I used to have fun with some phone scammers), it's far better to just block and ignore. Pissing off someone at the other end of a criminal fraud network can invite retaliation - they know your email is functional now, and your IP address, just for starters. That can narrow your location and enable discovery of other personal details. Remember, it's not some geeky teenager goofing around, it's someone part of a larger organization for whom email fraud might be among the least violent things they're willing to do for money and fun."

lxpipde,I saw some folks buying like 50 gift cards in a gas station recently and the cashier tried to explain to them they were getting scammed and they were very rude to her and laughed at her and told her to mind her own business. I have been wondering how that turned out.
lxq3vlh,"From what I hear, they often get mad at the banks / shops for letting them do this."
lxpd76h,"My team just stopped one of these, literally as the recipient was walking out the door to make the purchase. In this one minuscule case I have to thank AI based detections for alerting us to the email chain."
lxphbic,"Wait, I need more words. Your on site team were sending emails to discuss selling gcs to someone who may be purchasing gift cards for scammers, I think. And your detections to these types of conversations are built with (or supplemented with) AI?  Then your detection team discovered it and prevented in some way?

If so, rock on…if not, what do you mean?"
lxqdjsv,"I hadn't heard about AI-security before either, but found a really interesting blogpost on it:

https://ianchristopherryan.com/blog/2024-07-24-Generative-AI-Spam-Filter/

Current models achieve something like 98% success rate, but since you also need to consider false positives you can't really run it as a filter but more like a watchdog. Which, it sounds like OP did."
lxtme99,"AI security (or using AI for predicting, preventing and defending against online harms and crimes) is a real thing, that I know for sure. 

What I don’t get is how Shoesquirrel’s team detected it. What emails were monitored to find this potential exposure? Was this an insider event, or were on-site people emailing about the security footage of someone picking out a bunch of gift cards to buy, and their AI picked up on the internal emails, alerting the on-site folks to prevent the sale of the cards within the short time it took for the potential victim to make the purchase?  

I’m curious to know what happened, this isn’t clear what email chain was used in their detection."
lxpayyy,I work for local government and one of our town planners fell for this and lost 3k. I really don’t understand how people fall for this!
lxpfmjl,"I went in to get my car fixed a few years ago, and one of the mechanics was having a full-blown meltdown in the office.

He had gotten a call from someone telling him that there was a warrant for his arrest, and he needed to pay $1000 in Visa gift cards or they'd send the police to his house.

""I got kids, I can't go to jail!""

Unfortunately, he'd already sent them $500, but we were trying to convince him to not send the other $500 because it was a scam.  His boss called the Visa card people trying to get that money back, and even she was saying something like, ""Oh yeah, definitely a scam, please don't send them any more money"", while seeing if she could do anything to stop the payment.

Even with almost 10 people in that office, as well as the Visa lady, all talking him down, he was saying that he was convinced, but I'm still not so sure that he couldn't be talked right back into it if they called later that evening.

I felt so bad for him."
lxpsqv1,"My GF got this one but called me while she was still on the phone with them.  She was a bawling blubbering mess but I manged to get the details and told her to just hang up.  Don't say another word, just hang up.

Surprise. She never got arrested."
lxpubkc,"We have a close friend who fell for a similar scam like this, saying there was a warrant out for his arrest from an old DUI. He ended up paying the scammers close to $3k"
lxpvcoh,"I feel so bad for these people, not because of the scams, but because they must be absolutely no commonsense individuals."
lxpjcsp,"There's an old saying:


""Every day a dumbass gets out of the house"". 


That's why there are soooo many scammers. Because there are too many stupid people. Is it sad? Yes. But it's the truth. And they vote ... more than other people as we can clearly see. "
lxq3t28,I see what you did there…🤣
lxpqdst,"My mom literally fell for this like a month ago. I don't understand how.

She's not even that old, she's only like 50. She should know better than that."
lxpvo7f,Half of over 50 people I know walk around so dosed up on prescription drugs like anti depressants that they do some terribly stupid stuff.
lxpfgoo,My barber called me frantically one day and didn't know what to do. Sent like 3 or 4 900$ Nike gift card to federal agents to get a warrant cancelo lol. I felt so bad... He's a little older and doesn't know anything about computers or anything like that... Just lives under a rock. I felt so bad. Been telling him for years to get with the times.
lxpqghn,"I was actually buying gift cards for work, we did sweepstakes for a company and our third party didn't provide by the deadline so I had to buy it in a pinch. The employees at the cash register were so nice and kept asking if this was for somebody over the phone or paying off a debt. I knew they were referencing the scams and I kept reassuring them that this was legit. 


It's nice they were on the lookout and more people should be."
lxpz2ye,"You guys are just jealous that I'm going to get a 5 million dollar inheritance, and it only cost me 100 dollars in Steam gift cards to validate!"
lxp5ej3,"I had one from a women in her 20s! 

To me, this is the sign someone has a bad boss they’re afraid of questioning."
lxpimm4,No. They're just stupid. VERY stupid. 
lxpgkxh,My dad almost fell for it. Instead of sending pics he brought them to his boss. It happened when that scam was so new it wasn't heard of yet.
lxsruwv,"My great aunt fell for this, she’s unfortunately in the early stages of dementia and refuses to speak/listen to family trying to help. Got to the point that she lost her house"
lxpemdv,Wait. They did it?!
lxpgqck,My buddy's dad recently fell for the IRS block scam and sent $1400 in Walgreens gift cards. Unbelievable.
lxph8c8,"Yeah I don’t get this one, it takes so much effort and steps and often other people involved, no one of them get triggered?

Or is it digital gift cards?

Also if urgency is such a massive red flag to me, I am more likely to double check things and take it slow or even leave it until tomorrow if it is marked as urgent.

If it is actually urgent they will chance me on teams etc or call"
lxpj6c1,"I got something like that at my prior job. It came from an email that was something like ""yourbossofficial49576"" (because that's how that works) saying they were in an ""official meeting"" and needed gift cards to cover some kind of expense for executives.

It's like.... there's no way anyone could possibly fall for that, right?

But I also worked in IT and one of the things I got in email (that went to multiple people in IT, I didn't specifically handle this) was when people failed phishing spam test emails. They were sent out randomly to random people (so word didn't get around that they were sending out a round of phishing emails) and the number of people who clicked on it was astoundingly high. We got at least a few a week.

So maybe someone _would_ fall for Your Boss Official.

*edit:* My job before that wasn't in IT, but they also sent out test phish emails, but everyone got them. Every few months, the department manager would message us that they were coming later that day and to delete the email without clicking on anything. It's like... dude, you're not supposed to warn us. That's not how this works. (Despite that, I was told someone people still clicked on them anyway. Also, a few weeks before I started that job, someone clicked on a ransomware email link that started spreading through the company and shut the entire company down for several _weeks_ as they tried to clean the systems and prevent further damage.)"
lxpll4t,My husband almost fell for this one. I was kind of embarrassed for him for falling for it.
lxpnd38,"My friend almost fell for this.  She was literally at the store to get the gift cards when she broke the rule and texted our boss to ask a question about them and our boss, of course, had no idea what she was talking about.  I had gotten the same email but immediately deleted it."
lxpqvk8,"My Dad almost fell for this. It was more the ""Hey you owe us money so go buy gift cards and send them to us"". I guess on the way to the store he realized ""Why would a company want a debt to be paid in gift cards?"" and hung up on the scammer. Scary times for susceptible people."
lxpyvff,The grocery store I usually go to has a sign warning people about this right next to the gift cards now
lxq0khd,"It still astounds me that people think, that CEOs or massive companies want to pay in gift cards. Lol"
lxrqq5m,"$10,000 gone in one day.  My sister got the call from the “tax man”.  She asked mom for the cash.  Brother drove mom to the bank.  Then to sisters place with the cash.   Sister goes to Dollar General and local grocery store in a tiny town, buying $10,000 worth of gift cards and then calls in their numbers.  (Or photographing and txting- she won’t admit how she sent them)

How many adults were involved and continued to let this happen!?    Still boggles my mind!    Anyone spending $10,000 cash in a DAY in our lil hometown is not involved legal enterprise.  Even spending $5000 at the local IGA should have been a HUGE Red Flag."
lxrw55o,We had someone at work fall for that! She actually came into the office to deliver the gift cards to our boss and ask for reimbursement. Boss laughed right in her face.
ly5g6gg,But the scam doesn’t involve physically delivering them to your boss…
ly5gcho,"No, she just figured she'd do that after getting the email. She didn't reply to the scammer. She just thought the boss had emailed her and she went out and bought like $5000of gift cards with her own money."
lxrx8xj,"My boss got hit with that on a Saturday at work, he called his regional manager, and HE even said to go do it! The cashier at the CVS stopped the guy they sent to buy them and said ""it's a scam."" These are people who make 6 figures and manage hundreds of employees, and yet they can't figure out what's a scam."
lxspf47,"Yep, IT guy here.  Had a VP spend thousands on iTunes gift cards from Best Buy, scratched off the numbers and sent them in an email.  After he spent about $2K of his own money he asked the CEO for a reimbursement and he said he never sent that email.  No amount of phishing training will help, posters, remedial training will ever help.  People put a higher trust in email than anything else in the world."
lxu5nn1,"I work on the IT Help Desk for my state government and we had 2 different calls in the course of a week from people who got emails from their ""manager"" asking for hundreds of dollars and gift cards, and they actually sent them.

They waited until AFTERWARDS to call us and be like ""Hey, I think this was a scam."" Like yeah buddy, we could have warned you of that if you'd have called us before sending these gift cards. That or, I don't know, **go up to your boss and fucking ask them if the email is from them or not instead of just blindly assuming it's normal for your boss to ask you for hundreds of dollars in gift cards completely out of nowhere.**"
lxu7i97,"Yup, that last bit... How on earth doesn't anyone confirm such a weird request by simply asking is beyond me."
lxpe86p,"This nearly happened to someone I know! The email looked like it was from the president of a club that he is the treasurer of. It seemed plausible at first, but the email address did not match the real president’s address. 

I’m still wondering how the scammer got the name of the club president person, and linked it to the person I know. I guess emails are not confidential!"
lxpitrb,"You guess???


Please get off the internet. And don't use landlines either. For your own safety."
lxrx2kg,That was needlessly insulting.
lxpifuo,"Yes, and now i know a lot of stores that sell gift cards are aware and even ask people what they are buying for/cap out at a certain amount, so then the people being scammed go to MULTIPLE STORES and don't think twice about it?"
lxq2wel,"This happened to a colleague of mine just last week! An emergency meeting was called about it, as a good chunk of the staff got the same email from our ""boss"". The colleague was on the phone to her bank for ages, luckily was refunded. I was shocked she fell for it, thinking our actual boss would ask for something like that."
lxq3jo5,"Random bullshit story that I laugh about every once and a while when catfishing or similar things come up...  
 
My exwife would have probably fell for a giftcard/romance scam if I didn't try and be her friend after the marriage was done... she had agreed to a divorce and her ""affair partner"" had bailed... after she had paid a couple of his bills, and I was so over ""us"" I said, get on tinder and have fun like I am.    
 
We were weirdly of good terms so she showed me a match that she had and wanted me to try and look him up. She had two matches, this guy and someone who didn't reply to her. So apparently the one guy told her he was at some hotel(30min drive), and she went to meet up with him and he said something came up. I found nothing on the internet about him... yet he claimed to be a youtube creator. I laughed a little and jokingly said ""He's going to ask you for money.""  
 
So about a week later she came up to me and said ""You'll never believe what happened."" The guy asked her to go to the store and buy him a prepaid phone card so he could call her. The loops he went through, once she refused to go get him that card he wanted was hilarious."
lxq405j,"My own husband (ex husband now) fell for a gift card scam. He got a text from someone who was supposedly our phone carrier and said that if we paid that month's bill with gift cards, they would give us 75% off next months bill.
I wasn't home at the time by the time I did get home. He had just gotten back from the store from getting the gift cards and had called the number back and they didn't answer and that gave him his first clue. 🙄 Fuckin moron 🙄"
lxq58of,My mother in law’s “pastor” texted her saying he forgot to get a $500 iTunes gift card for a cancer patient. I wasn’t surprised she fell for it and she rushed out to buy one. But I was mad when she told me a woman she knew from Church helped her work out how to text the photo. The woman was early 40s! Who at that age doesn’t know that’s a scam?!
lxq8taw,"I work at home depot. We're not allowed to stop or ask about gift cards anymore if they're under $2,000. Really. Have a lady come in daily buying $500 worth and we can't stop her"
lxqvtg0,"Knew someone a couple years ago who held a director level position at the company they were at. Bought about $2000 in apple gift cards on their company credit card to send to the “CEO”. Obviously this was fake. They realized it was a scam and just said nothing. No mention to a single person. Eventually an audit was done on charges and when they were questioned here is what they said. 

“I just figured I’d have to pay it back at some point. The CEO reaching out made me feel special so I went and got the cards.”

No real understanding or awareness of the issue. No realization that you can’t just run away from the issue. Asked why they didn’t mention anything so we could attempt a chargeback or report it and nothing.

Amazingly this person is still employed in the same position with a company card and it was essentially swept under the rug. They won’t make that specific mistake…actually I wouldn’t be surprised if they do. Not the sharpest tool in the shed."
lxrkgvh,"Crazy that someone would drop $5000 for their boss, much less after a random email request for gift cards. That at least warrants a phone call."
lxubmu7,"Used the work credit card. And no, they didn't get fired."
lxrpizj,And the shop didn't stop them? Where I am they all have signs saying they wont sell more then £100 or 3 cards to anyone and tells people that if some is asking for gift cars as payment it's a scam.
lxrufet,This happened at my workplace as well!
lxruirw,"I love those. Got one via text who told me he was calling on behalf of my brother, who needed bail money overseas. Since my brother was in the very next room this seemed unlikely. Scammer asked for $2000 but said the jail only accepts gift cards now!

I kept him informed of my ""journey"" as I went to my car, drove down to the nearest Walmart, and found the gift card aisle, Snapping photos all the way as he requested.

Finally he tells me to buy the gift cards, scratch the silver off the back, and send him a picture of it.
I kept pretending to not know what that meant  Took him 1 1/2 hours to finally give up . Meanwhile I just grocery shopped."
lxrwhvh,My wife fell for this. Luckily we called the VISA place and they actually refunded all our money. It was a miracle!
lxrxnk1,"I work in a small office and one of the newer workers got an email from someone pretending to be the director of my company asking for $200 in gift cards. The employee's desk was about 20 feet from the director's office. 

So, instead of going to the director and asking, or going to anyone in the office and asking, the employee bought the gift cards, sent the codes over by email, then went to my director to ask if he received them.

The director was nice enough to give the guy the $200 he lost, but the guy quit a couple weeks later."
lxryi2u,"""hello I am the police, we have been watching you're internet and no you have done a crime, pay a fine of $5,000 in iTunes giftcards or we sent someone to arrest you for 6,000,000 years in jail.""

Adults for some reason: OH NO! don't send anyone I will pay the fine!"
lxrzk64,"We got one of those from our ""boss"" when my boss was literally standing next to me. I then kept on asking him if I could go to Walmart instead of working."
lxs2tyz,It's becoming a classic scam and people still fall for it :/
lxs505p,I fell for this
lxs6g5s,"My wife went as a gift card scammer for Halloween, won all the costume contests our company held"
lxs6gmb,"They like to start these at my job by saying ""I'm calling from corporate.  Do you know who this is?"" which is a lovely attempt to get a name they can use next time.  I really wanna just start guessing bullshit names to feed them disinformation."
lxsbtun,2 of our BUSINESS teachers fell for that one
lxsnw0e,"A friend mine, his mom got caught in the IRS scam to get gift cards and only realized it was a scam after buying gift cards to send them the numbers of. She got home, called them back and had some choice words for them. A few hours later while she was on the phone with my friend, the cops came banging at her door and slammed her on the ground saying someone called them to report she killed her husband. Husband wasn't even in the same state at the time, my friend was still on the phone during this whole interaction and freaking out because he lives in Europe. The cops didn't even apologize for slamming her on the ground, got all the scammer info and left."
lxsobv4,Jfc one of my mom's friends asked about that while I was visiting once. At least she asked someone first. My mom (who is 84 and not at all gullible) patiently explained the scam to her. A lot of people are just too trusting and can't believe horrible people like these scammers exist.
lxxa5eo,"My mom fell victim to this scam 😭 $2,000 worth of google play gift cards. She has been trying to get rid of them for two years now."
lxpeum2,"These are horrible and just about anyone can fall for one. The intent is to get you into fight or flight mode so your logical thinking goes out the window.

I am in a position where I meet with people of all ages and intelligence that have fallen for these scams.

It's not always gift cards and bitcoin they request. If you think you're immune to a scam like this, I assure you you're not. Be vigilant people."
lxq1poo,"I have gotten hit with so many different flavors of scam and sussed them all out immediately - one time I even reported a legit company email as spam/scam lmao but I guess better safe than sorry 💀

For context: that email came from a third party that my company was using, not my company itself and it was not one I was familiar with (it was new), so that’s why I didn’t click the link and reported it lol"
lxpiwv3,Not anyone. You must be mentally challenged or stupid. 
lxr7676,"Agreed. We *all* get scam calls/emails/texts on a weekly basis. We intelligent people delete the message, or ignore the phone call, before they can even try to rope us into the scam. Smart people can see the scam from *a mile* away. Phone number I don't know? Scam. Duplicate Facebook account for someone I'm already friends with? Scam. Pretty lady randomly DMing me? Scam. Nigerian prince? Scam. ""Law Enforcement""? Scam. An 'American' person who can barely speak/type English? Scam.

If it's vague enough, we might reply to it, but then we'll immediately realize it's a scam. Only idiots are getting into long conversations with these scammers, and only the most stupid of the stupid are actually following their instructions and taking real world action to meet their demands."
lxp7l24,I got one and *fell* for it for about 3 minutes. In my case it is not a ridiculous request. I’ve definitely had stranger. Went to email him back and voila.
lxpgeqv,The one I got was supposedly from the ceo from a spoofed email just asking if I was onsite today which wasn’t a rare request. So I just responded that I am today and what can I help them with? Then they immediately went to please buy $500 of gift cards which was small potatoes as usually they would be asking for a ton of patient information or business metrics that would be the usual request.
lxpvjax,Happened to someone I know. Same amount too. Younger woman just out of college at her first big girl job. So unfortunate. I think the company ended up reimbursing her since it came from a legit company email or something to that effect.
lxpwanq,"Happened where I work, too, the same way. I think they got $2K of gift cards from the employee who fell for it."
lxq0qnt,"One of the directors at my old company fell for this once, an email he got “from the CEO”. This is one of the top people in the entire company. I was shocked. I was an early 20’s secretary and I was like dude are you kidding me"
lxq34rg,I had a retiree almost fall for this. She said she was on the phone with said scammer driving to CVS to buy the gift cards and the cashier refused to sell them to her telling her that it’s a common scam and if it’s really XYZ company then they should be able to hang up and them call back to their official number no problem right? Luckily the cashier convinced the retiree it was a scam. Turned out alright luckily for everyone
lxq6l5w,My mom has 8 grandkids in one branch of the family. We have to explain to the cashier *and* the manager of the local Target every year around the holidays why we're buying so many gift cards at once.
lxq6wmj,"I fell for that one, but I had random people in the real world ""encouraging"" me to keep doing it when I refused."
lxq799d,My local supermarket has signs up warning against this. Hopefully it saves some people
lxqadwe,"I unfortunately replied to one from my boss. It was the ""I was trying to get ahold of you"" sent on my day off. And while it was unusual for the big boss to contact me directly it wasn't unheard of. So I replied ""oh I had the day off what did you need?"" And the next email was then ""I'm a meeting and need you to get gift cards for clients"". I felt so dumb"
lxqbrsf,"I know a 30/m restaurant GM who almost got caught up by someone claiming to be law enforcement and investigating their district manager. Knew the names of every higher up and that's what got him.. when he was halfway thru emptying the safe to go get the cards when he realized law enforcement wouldn't call you with a heads up, and they don't accept fucking GIFT CARDS!

I made fun if him for a long time."
lxqd04g,Guy who worked for the same company as my wife got one asking for like 3500 in Victoria’s Secret gift cards and the guy actually did it 😭
lxqdcph,I had someone try this a few months after I was laid off from a job.
lxqej17,I like that a lot of retail locations have signs now warning people plus the staff are more alert and will ask questions if someone is buying an unusual number of gift cards.  Probably saved a lot of people.
lxqgsfh,"my coworker literally just fell for the exact same thing - we are a remote company and based all around the US. she literally was running around her city ON FOOT to go to different stores because her car was in the shop.... the kicker is, she's known our boss for years and has his number saved in her phone, yet for some reason believed the sketchy random number texting her was also him?"
lxqieg0,"I had this happen with air b and b, got locked out saying I lost my privileges for being a bad user. I'd never used air b and b it was my first time making an account. Saw a customer service number to discuss the problem, when I called, the man said hi... not hello thank you for calling air b and b customer service how can I help you. So 1 sketchy.

Then I told the guy the problem with air b and be and he says okay you need to get, 200$ gift cards and blah blah blah and I was like what. Gift cards? He's like, yeah, at least this many, and then you can fix the problem. I said back to him what he said to me and then hung up. Found the correct number and fixed the problem. I know it was a scam and knew right away and air b and be had no answer as to why they were able to put that number on the app."
lxqlw1s,Happened to my boyfriend!
lxqmh8l,"My mom did this


She thought the IRS wanted to be paid back in Apple cards"
lxqp6zz,Our email system blocks at least 10 of these a week.
lxqpqws,"I know its awful thing to happen 😔 but sadly people are still being caught out and scammed.  I for one, over a well known chain store gift card. 😞😡🤬😥"
lxqqjux,"I was going into work a few months ago at a payment center, and a woman was demanding to be allowed in, because she wanted to speak with someone about the gift cards she bought to pay her bill. 

Was about 20 minutes late going in, but I talked her down, convinced her she was speaking with a scammer, and walked her through setting up an account through our app and making a payment. 

Thank God she didn't send pictures of the card to anyone, and was too confused by the process the scammers wanted her to go through so she just came to the office."
lxqrmta,"Every damn ""National Administrative Professionals Day"" (Wednesday of the last full week in April), my entire team gets spammed by multiple accounts masquerading as me wanting to buy my admin asst. gift cards.  
  
I wouldn't mind, given the fact that I don't HAVE an admin assistant.  But the scams worked THREE TIMES (twice on the same person).  The victim's excuse?  ""I didn't realize our team didn't have an admin assistant.""  
  
HR Representative:  So that's why you sent out a company-wide email calling anyone who fell for the scam an idiot?  
Me: Technically, I called *everyone* in the company idiots.  And I stand behind that statement."
lxqs7ei,Trump
lxqtvu4,"Seriously. I work 911 and the amount of people that call in saying a ""deputy"" called them and told them to pay fines for missing jury duty or go to jail. Then tell them to buy Apple gift cards. They'll string them along for thousands to multiple stores, and then only some of them think that something might be up.

1. Did you receive any letter about jury duty? No?

2. Why would the sheriff's office/courts deal in Apple gift cards? Or any gift cards? Do you think you pay speeding tickets that way? 

3. The police won't usually tell you they're coming to arrest you. They'll just go do it.

Despite these,  people get ran for thousands of dollars with these."
lxqu90z,Why would anyone even consider doing so for their boss
lxquf7u,I know an IT CEO who built up the company and was farming Bitcoin who fell for it. It was just so crazy.
lxqv5em,"My company has had at least 10 calls from the CEO, owner, owner's gardener, fire department, etc...

They have the cashiers cunt all the money at the location, take pictures of the safes, put the money in FedEx boxes, etc.

Some followed way too many orders but no money was lost.  I had to develop training but even then, a couple too
K the calls."
lxqwo40,This one is so prevalent that my company had to have everyone do training on how to NOT fall for this.
lxqypqz,"My partner had not long started at her current job when she got an email from the ""CEO"" asking her to get £250 worth of gift cards. So she went to the shop and spent £250 on gift cards. The lady at the checkout said they were non refundable. 

After she bought them she emailed the CEO and said she had them. The CEO asked her to send a picture.

For some reason, she decided to phone me and ask me if it was okay to send it. 

I said no. I also said, please don't tell me you've just spent £250 on gift cards. Thank the gods that she did call me. Otherwise it would have been lost.

We then gifted them out over Christmas/Birthdays."
m19xeia,Wholesome ending.
lxqyxcn,"My mom fell for that one. Call from ""Microsoft"", telling her to buy *Apple* gift cards. Luckily, she only bought one and then called me. When we talked about it afterwards, she said she was so overwhelmed by their threats of bricking her computer that she went on autopilot and didn't even realize that this was two very different companies."
lxqzi2h,"Had one Saturday from the CEO.

But also a few years ago, when these first started I had not heard of this type.  Day two of a brand new job, I got an email from the owner to my 1 day old email address.

I lost 300 that day… embarrassing as hell."
lxr08nz,"I was the treasurer of a non-profit for several years. My contact info was available online. At least once a week, I'd get an email saying that [President] needed me wire $25,000 to [random person/email] immediately.

Yeah, given that our gross receipts for the year were around $80K, it is highly unlikely that the president would be spending that amount of money before

a) getting it approved by the board

b) speaking to me *personally* on my personal/not publicly accessible cell phone number

But, guess these scammers have to shoot their shot. They must have success sometimes."
lxr0cxl,A cousin and my sister-in-laws parents both fell for this mess.  Just some random person called them & they both sent thousands. 
lxr0rno,"I developed an entire B2B phishing training for a small IT company I used to work for. We had about 100 small businesses that we managed at that time. 

Shocked me how many people fell for the boss gift card one. Everyone who fell for it did zero authorization checks, did not double check with their actual bosses, just immediately complied with my request. 

As they say, the biggest weakness in a computer system is the human in the chair. Trust is the ultimate factor is manipulating a weakness"
lxr0uvb,"My friend got an even weirder one. One of his managers got a scam call and was convinced he had to take the money from the deposit box, convert it to Bitcoin, and send it to someone's wallet. 

You'd think he was part of the scam. But not, just that stupid. It confused the company, they were convinced he was in on it. Nope. Just that stupid."
lxr1nb4,It's getting even worse now with the power of AI to manipulate the voices. Now they can call and pretend to the the boss and no longer email or SMS texts.
lxr33x2,"Funny thing about this one, Sony support actually did request gift cards to unlock my sisters account, which was really strange. It locked because I reversed a charge that was being used for PlayStation Plus and forgot it was going to auto charge for next year. I kept responding to their automated email, asking them if I could pay other with some sort of actual payment method, but they just kept responding with the automated email, no matter how many times I’d request an alternative method or request to at least receive a message that was written by a person. Finally, we caved in and just decided “alright, if it works, great. If not, well we’re just out so and so dollars and we’ll just give up the account.” We got the cards, paid the balance, and the account was unlocked! I think we had paid a little over because we also had a little leftover amount on the account to use in the psn store. Not sure why they go the gift card method, seems shady and terrible, but one of the extremely few occasions sending gift cards in an email worked"
lxr5jfe,"Yeah, I've had a CFO falling for this 2 years ago...Never looked at her the same after that."
lxr69i7,"My grandma got a phone call from a “friend” asking for £500 in apple gift cards to “buy her son a present”. This is not someone she’s that close with, but even still she was ready to go and do it.

Once my grandad found out he had a good job convincing her it was a scam, she’s incredibly stubborn and doesn’t change her mind easily. So despite being presented with overwhelming evidence she wouldn’t back down. They had to phone the friend to confirm of course she didn’t want any giftcards"
lxoz9fo,That one where you get a random “wrong number” text from a gorgeous woman who wants to get to know you. I promise no actual women want to get to know a random stranger they accidentally texted.
lxp12so,"I'm a woman and I just got one the other day...but it said ""want to go fishing with us?"" and I got excited because based on who I am that seemed legit. Unfortunately when I asked who was texting me I got the standard ""this is Madeline, didn't you save my number?"" and was immediately filled with rage"
lxp1el3,Soo…wanna go fishing?
lxp1lgf,Sorry Madeline I'm busy 😂
lxp3rly,My assistant gave me this number. I hope I did not disturb your beautiful day. Do you use Telegram or WhatsApp?
lxpcbm9,They always wanna use another app
lxpxdjo,"Because most of the world uses WhatsApp for messaging, so they can do all their scamming from their laptop with the WhatsApp web interface"
lxpyhvz,"Yeah a couple tried to get me to install wechat. I was like ""fuck off loser"""
lxq843g,"I thought WeChat is mostly free from scammers, considering very complex rules of registration. Isn’t it?"
lxqaqql,"It’s only hard to sign up if you’re outside of China. If you’re in China it’s easy, afaik you only need a Chinese phone number. And yes they have scammers too"
lxv2xhu,Never go to a second application.
lxp78w4,How does Telegram and WhatsApp fit into it?
lxpk8vx,"I've heard plenty of theories over on r/scambait, where it's asked a lot. They include:

1. The phone they're using has limited text plan, and both apps are free.  
2. Both apps are end-to-end encrypted and nearly impossible to trace, so scammers are safely hidden.   
3. Phones are used by the honey-trappers, then the victim is passed to bosses who use the apps.  
4.  The apps are easier to use when multiple scams are being run at once--each conversation gets its own open window.

It's probably some combination of the above, but they always seem to insist on switching to an app. And by ""insist"" I mean once they bring it up, they keep bringing it up over and over and over, ad nauseam."
lxq99wc,Also WhatsApp and telegram have a profile picture. It's free and easy to send photos to make the scammer seem real
lxqa5on,"They almost always send a picture by text first anyway. The scammer sends a stolen pic of a young, artractive Asian midel: ""This is me [ri-i-ght]. May I see a picture of you?"""
lxpce63,"I came here for this question. I was stringing one along once pretending to be Kevin from the office and they kept trying to get me to use WhatsApp or telegram. I kept telling them I didn't know Morse code. Anyway, why couldn't they just keep talking to me on text message?"
lxpvqd1,"Switching apps makes it so the initial point of contact and then the followup are disconnected, so that any anti-scam measures and reporting can't be enforced. If you report the initial contact, on platform 1, it looks innocent and not unsolicited spam. Just a wrong number and small talk or whatever, but no mention of some investment or scam pitch or anything. So if you report it, there's nothing actionable.

But on platform 2, even though the scam gets mentioned explicitly, it looks like you already knew each other, due to the nature of how you initially connect. Switching platforms keeps their accounts from appearing to look like they are behaving suspiciously. You added them, after all."
lxqqydd,Ah gotcha. That makes sense. Thanks!

lxpkq7w,"Encrypted messages, which makes it harder to prosecute. "

lxpp4hz,How do those scams work anyways? Is it just to build repoire?
lxq43bx,"They text/call you to establish it’s a used number. 

Then they hope to snag you into using WhatsApp or Telegram or a similar app. 

If they can get you to jump into their scam…perfect. 

If not…they will sell your number to other people and those people will harass you too in hopes someone will reel you in. 

It’s best just to block and report junk and delete….than to answer"
lxq5jiz,"From what I've heard they build rapport and try and get you to invest in shady crypto schemes, which the scammers then pump and dump. People tend to fall for this scam because the ""woman"" is usually not openly flirtatious and won't ask you to send her money directly via sketchy methods. She'll just talk about investments with you and nudge you in the direction of investing in the tokens that the scammers want you to."
lxs0208,"That is the first step. The second step is asking for a small amount of money. Bus faire to get to work, or some food.  Always increasing the amount and the circumstance.

lxppfwv,"I got one the other day from a local number saying ""I thought you were going to be in the office today?"" and it made me panic briefly because I have ADHD and this is extremely plausible. But I also realized that whoever would be texting me that would already be in my phone."

Again, this is public information.  It's not restricted.  It also doesn't make me anymore a person of interest because they wouldn't know what information I have access to.  A clearance doesn't mean you can just walk into the pentagon and browse the clearance level of the library.  Clearance means that I can be appointed to projects and receive information in those projects.  I could have a clearance and have no projects, I could know about what actually happened in area 51.

If there was a public database or you could ask for a list of cleared persons (both of which a quick search couldn't find and Google AI says doesn't exist), you still exist in a sea of anonymity that protects you. Once you start connecting yourself to people individually, you start eroding that anonymity.

ly6ljd1,"> Theres a reason you don't see people wearing ""I have a clearence"" buttons when visiting foreign countries.

>There is no way for them to know what you have access to but they do now know that you have access. You have separated yourself from the group of people who dont have one and thus increased your risk.

Cool, that has nothing to do with what we're talking about now does it.

>If there was a public database or you could ask for a list of cleared persons

There is.  It's called a FOIA request.  As long as that isn't considered classified information, the government provides it.

>you still exist in a sea of anonymity that protects you

Firstly, anonymity doesn't protect you.  Secondly, having a clearance doesn't make you a target because a clearance doesn't mean you have access to something useful.  There are tens of thousands of people that have clearances but not projects attached to their clearance.

>Ultimately if Russia wanted to find people with clearances at random, they could probably do it on compiled information.

I mean, they do.  But that doesn't mean anything.  Because ""having a clearance"" doesn't mean anything except that you've had an intense background check from the government.  That's literally the only information you can gleam from someone announcing their clearance.

I could work on a nuclear submarine, I could be a NASA scientist, I could be a data analyst for the FBI, I could be a government contractor for the DoD, I could be a secretary of a lobbyist, I could have been employed by something that required a clearance, or I could be a retired army vet.  You have no idea.  That means you can't target someone for information.  Even if you know that they have a clearance in a place that you want information from, you have no idea if they're assigned to that project.

You've watched too many movies and think that a clearance simply means that you can walk into any place and access everything at your level.  It doesn't.  The only way you get classified information is to be assigned to it.  Period.  Simply having a clearance means you had a background check.  That's it.  Nothing else."
ly6wn56,"Getting a little testy? 

> anonymity doesn't protect you

Lol yes it does?

> having a clearance doesn't make you a target

Russia has the option to spy on two groups of people. Everyone who has a clearance. And everyone who doesn't. Which do they choose? Cmon now.

> That means you can't target someone for information. 

But they are more likely to possess it.

> Even if you know that they have a clearance in a place that you want information from, you have no idea if they're assigned to that project.

But they are more likely to be.

Imagine being in a room with 1000 people. Each person holds a concealed marble. Someone is looking for the person with the black marble. They will use any means necessary to find out who, even nefarious ones. There are 998 white ones. You have a blue one. 

What you're saying is tantamount to saying aloud ""I dont have a white one"" and thinking you are somehow just as safe as if you kept your mouth shut. 

You arent. You can try and spin it any way you want to.  You can reply to me til you're blue in the face. But you openly telling the Chinese and internet strangers that you have a clearance is stupid. Maybe the reality is only 498 people have white marbles, and 5 black. But you are still increasing your risk, for literally no gain. Which again, is stupid.

By all means continue. I have no skin in the game. I'm just letting you know. 

> You've watched too many movies and think that a clearance simply means that you can walk into any place

I'm not sure why you think I've said this. I never have. I know what they are and how they work. 

All I've said is it picks you out of the pool of anonymity as a higher potential target. Even if you dont know anything...if China comes poking around into your life...it probably won't be pleasant. And hell...hopefully they actually believe you when you say it...but that'll never happen...right?

Edit: BTW, the government routinely laughs in the face of FOIA. Even if its not classified."
ly6y9tr,"> Getting a little testy?

Nope.  Just annoyed that you seemingly have no idea what you're talking about.

>Lol yes it does?

What does it protect me from?

>Russia has the option to spy on two groups of people. Everyone who has a clearance. And everyone who doesn't. Which do they choose? Cmon now.

This really just emphasizes that you don't understand what a clearance is.  They spy on both.  Because there are people without clearances that have access to sensitive  things.  Clearance doesn't mean you just have a treasure trove of documents on your hands.

>Imagine being in a room with 1000 people. Each person holds a concealed marble. Someone is looking for the person with the black marble. They will use any means necessary to find out who, even nefarious ones. There are 998 white ones. You have a blue one.

It's cute, but it doesn't work as an analogy.

>I'm not sure why you think I've said this. I never have. I know what they are and how they work.

You continue to make statements like you are an authority on the matter, that's why.

>All I've said is it picks you out of the pool of anonymity as a higher potential target.

Except that it doesn't.  I've provided you tons of information, and you continue to insist that someone having a BACKGROUND CHECK is a potential target.

>BTW, the government routinely laughs in the face of FOIA. Even if its not classified.

Ah yes, so at least you acknowledge that you were wrong.  That's nice.

Here, a simple question for you.  Ignore everything else and answer this.  Let's assume I tell you I have a beyond top secret clearance.  What information does that give you about what I have?  Why would a foreign government want to spy on me knowing only that information?"
ly705ko,"> Ah yes, so at least you acknowledge that you were wrong

The cognitive dissonance is real. YOU said anyone can access a list of cleared people through a FOIA. I said the government would laugh in your face if you tried to get one with a FOIA. *Youre* in the wrong lol.

> Ignore everything else and answer this. Let's assume I tell you I have a beyond top secret clearance. What information does that give you about what I have? Why would a foreign government want to spy on me knowing only that information?

Spy 1: ""We have a limited amount of time and money to spy on people. At full capacity, we could spy on 10,000 people per year. Who should we look at?""

Spy 2: Well the higher the classification, the more damage to our adversaries if uncovered. So spy on 9,999 randos...and include that one guy on who openly says he has Beyond Top Secret. Even if he doesn't end up knowing anyone, he's more likely to than some rando.""

&nbsp;

If you still can't grasp this. Again feel free to keep telling random foreigners. Good luck."
ly722q0,"> The cognitive dissonance is real.

Well at least you acknowledge you have it.

>YOU said anyone can access a list of cleared people through a FOIA.

Correct.

>I said the government would laugh in your face if you tried to get one with a FOIA.

You did say that, but it's not correct.  Yes, they can deny a FOIA, but they have to have grounds to do so.

>Spy 1: ""We have a limited amount of time and money to spy on people. At full capacity, we could spy on 10,000 people per year. Who should we look at?""

And thus proving you don't know what a clearance is.  Again, I can have that clearance and have no access to anything.  Because a clearance is a background check.  Period.  Full stop.  Just because I have one does not grant me the right to go access documents or look at secrets.  The Russians already know this, which is why they don't care if someone has a clearance.

>If you still can't grasp this.

I can't grasp it because it has nothing to do with reality."

ly8szgk,"I wasn't responding to you that you need to report a scam text but to others who decided to pick that part. 

It's continued contact.

Speaking from experience, overseas family/friends, foreign friends, etc. must be reported. There's a bit of a hint dropped that they can check your messages, so don't share anything that might be skirting the line of what you can't share. Usually, you are not allowed devices made in China, either."
lxsw0cc,No you don’t. Close and continuing. Like a roommate. But not a visitor and certainly not a wrong number.
ly18x5f,"> But not a visitor and certainly not a wrong number.

This is incorrect.  Any personal foreign interaction has to be reported.  If you don't you risk losing your clearance if they investigate you.  It's literally why some of the espionage cases have been found is that someone didn't report a singular interaction with a foreign national.  Especially from countries that are hostile, like China, North Korea, Russia, and Iran."
ly61dx8,"No. Of course not.  If you have CLOSE AND CONTINUING contact. Like a Roomate or boyfriend/girlfriend.  A friend invited his business associate who was a government official from UAE to my house!  I was pissed, reported it, and the security officer said “we don’t care”. Hahah. They explained the rules to me then.  I can go to embassy parties and not report any of it."
ly18acs,"> Do all people with federal clearance have to report like this?

Maybe you held a temporary secret or had a basic background check done, but you haven’t even been to the most basic of security training, let alone a briefing.

lxpuczb,"Coworker got one of those. Talked to him all about crypto and walked him through starting a crypto wallet. Of course he gave her the password so she could help. Couple hundred dollars later the account is empty and she won't respond to his texts. He's still investing in crypto because ""it sounded like a good way to make money""."
lxpuufs,"I got a varriant where the chick acclaims she got my number via friend. Wouldn't say what friend. Said she doesn't do socials & wanted to marry me & have 14 kids

When I blocked the fake number, instantly got a text asking if I didn't like her form a diff number"
lxpw097,"Yeah, I got one of those a few months back. The moment a wrong number attempts to keep a conversation going, you know its going to be a scam. I hadnt seen the scam before, so I decided to stay on the line and see how the script worked, pretending to play along.

part 1: an “assistant” acts as a filter to vet suckers. If you look like a hot prospect, they pass you off to their “boss” and then try to get you onto a whatsapp conversation which is encrpyted and set to terminate messages after 90 days. This is to make evidence collection in a lawsuits discovery phase much more difficult, as well as make it harder to backtrace the scammers ID and location.

part 2: the “hook”. The scammer tries to build rapport and entice you with a potential relationship while also bragging about their lavish lifestyle, showing off their house and car in beverly hills. They are in the “import” business and make most of their money from “investments”. They are generous, claiming to go to charity galas and donating $50,000.

 part 3: the “bait”. They want to share their passion for investing with you. What kind of investing? oh, just trading short term options on the forex market for precious metals, specifically “gold”. They show off their latest trades which appear to be very profitable. “Wow, you will help me do that too?!??” is what they want you to ask. They are more than happy to help. You ask “How do you time the market so well?!” and the lady says her old aunt has an algorithm that detects signals in the market and she wants to share those with you…

part 4: the “scam”. She tells you to open an investing account on some shady looking webpage. It asks you to give all your banking info, do an ACH to fund your “investing” account. The website is shady as fuck. You do like 5 minutes of due dilligence and its obviously scammy. Anyways, presumably you “fund” the account and then you get an invest “signal”, go all in, and low and behold the fake market goes upside down and you lose all your money. In reality, you were already robbed the moment you funded the account, but they just need some flimsy pretext to take your money from you."
lxpxpig,"I got one from someone pretending they were trying to text their vet because their dog was sick.  It ALMOST got me talking, until about an hour later, and they texted me a picture of them and their pooch that was miraculously fine, and it was so obviously staged/edited/not real that I realized it was a scammer trying to get personal info from me."
lxpxzyu,I got one of those a few months ago. My wife and I had some fun with it.
lxpz08o,I mess with these folks all the time. Practically a hobby at this point.
lxpz9aw,"I kept one of them on the line for a few days, said they just wanted a friend. But like....a text outta nowhere trying to develop a friendship is weird no matter how hot they are.

Plus I'm old and married and I don't need my wife wondering why I'm texting some baddie.

lxqa7rd,"i used to mess with them but im pretty sure its just a.i. so thay got boring quick. ended up with more random ""wanna meet for dinner"" texts. i just block em now"
lxqazci,These ones are starting to get more clever. My fiancé got a text from someone asking about some specific event (I can't remember what it was) and it seemed to be a wrong number text. He texted back to say it was the wrong number and then the scammer/bot thanked him and then started with the 'I want to get to know you' thing and she/he/it was immediately blocked.

lxqcnui,No gorgeous ones anyway...
lxqd5ps,I had an old lady text me by accident then wanted to be friends. Bulllshit
lxqeyd3,Those one always made me laugh. I would entertain them for all of a second then I ignore them. You can tell they are clearly fishing for information. They try so hard to be extra friendly and such to the point of being suspious.
lxqghbo,99.99999% of the time you are right but I used to work with a guy in about 2013 who literally met his wife this way.
lxqhw7n,"There are many people with NPD or people that score somewhat high on the narcissist traits that simply want armcandy or a trophy wife/hubs.

They can’t fathom being scammed.

No way! They are successful and hella attractive! And they deserve a successful and/or beautiful partner! 

They have always dated 5’s and now they want to date a 9 and a 10! Even well in their 40’s they think they can pull a 20 year old OF MODEL! 

Yes! Believe it!"

lxqqazp,"Actually, yeah they do. We had phone sex once a year and that was the only time she ever called me. I believe it was the start of her bipolar cycle. Then I lost the phone number to the police.

I believe that it was because I also had an American phone number thanks to an S.I.P. number so it's not that weird. She actually genuinely could have just misdialed and I mean she never asked for anything. Me and me gave me anything. Well she did ask for some things but I was very happy to give them. They weren't financial and I mean I got some things in return but very strange relationship that one

lxqr9ch,About 10 years ago now I actually did get a text from a random woman and actuality met up and slept with her. I'm kind of sad for all these young guys now getting scammed by this.
lxqsb4u,"I would normally just ignore and if possible block (not worth doing it for texts the number was probably randomly spoofed anyhow), but I got one on Signal so I engaged a little bit in case it was actually a lead for a news story. But it only took a couple of messages to confirm it was just spam."
lxqvp3p,"I still constantly get these friend requests where it's some very attractive woman with 3-4 photos (some of which aren't even the same person) and 5 friends.

When I see one of them is one of my friends it tells me a lot about that person."
lxqw5j1,"I got one of those and when I said I wasn't the person they were looking for I got the ""I'm sorry for bothering you"" spiel and I immediately knew it was some sort of scam even though I had not heard of this scam yet."
lxqxpgr,"i got one of these on a Friday evening around 7pm that said ""Hey do you have time to go to the gym with me""

I replied with ""its fucking friday evening and your asking me to go to the gym?! no true friend of mine would ever request this, fuck off"""

If you're ever on the East Coast, let me know, and I'll bring you over to my family for dinner.

lxp6zst,"In the early 2000’s, I went to a party with a then coworker at this older coworker couples’ house that nobody knew very well.  It was a beautiful suburban house. Once everyone was feeling pretty good from drinks at around 10pm, they said, “Do you want the tour?” We all grabbed a drink and went on the tour, which ended in the basement, where there was a big stock room of vitamins and supplements, and a giant poster (and somewhat of a shrine) of a sketchy guy in a leather blazer with an 80’s haircut. I started laughing and said, “What the f*** is all this, and who the f*** is that?!”  

We sell supplements, and that’s (name) who started the company. He was tragically murdered by his wife (bow heads in sorrow).  I was like, “Whaaaaat?!”  Anyway, then came the sales pitch about these revolutionary supplements, getting in early and how much they’ve made. Everyone just awkwardly declined. Then we went back upstairs and nobody spoke of it the rest of the night.  

I ran into an old coworker recently and he brought it up. One of the weirdest situations I’ve ever found myself in. The couple moved to the west coast and apparently had an ugly divorce."
lxpwabl,"I have a similar story! 

We went to what we thought was a house warming party. Only one other guest. The wife spent a lot of time on the phone asking people if they were on their way. Weird, but my husband, the other host and I opened the wine we brought and it was awkward but not terrible. We tried to make conversation with the small group when suddenly the wife told us it was time for the presentation and then puts on a demonstration with Norwex, cleaning towels with “Bac-lock technology.” She even used a raw egg to show the bacteria cleaning power. I won a free Norwex wash cloth somehow and during a lull in the presentation, my husband stood up, said we had to leave and we basically ran out while she chased us with the free cloth and the open bottle of wine to give back to us."
lxq0nvo,I deliver Norwex boxes to people (carrier) and it pains me to know I've just spotted another MLM dummy.

lxs2cfl,I went to a dinner party where this crazy lady tried to sell us her Serenity candles. Unbelievably awkward night. She sang us country songs and smashed her boyfriend’s flat screen tv.

A lot of people don't realize that even if it is not a ""scam"" you will spend all your time burning family relationships and friendships hard selling this shit. Then you will be known as the person to avoid because you are always hard selling, or you owe them money, or it is awkard bc you said know etc."

One day after work ended he invited me and the other guy that worked for him to dinner at his house to discuss business. We thought he meant like growing the landscaping business.

  
We were served Mac and cheese and a hot dog and afterwards they brought out this book of famous away millionaires. It was basically a huge bound fancy book with huge pictures of properties and boats and cars and a blurb under each one detailing how so and so made it all happen with Amway. They told us they were going to be rich and they wanted us to be rich too.

We politely declined. I quit at the end of the summer but kept in touch with my coworker. Turned out the owner kept putting money into tapes, books, etc etc from his away upstream manager or whatever and bankrupted his business.

  
He was a really hard working nice guy. It definitely taught me a lesson."

Whatever company that promises a white Mercedes to their high performing reps.

The funny thing was that everyone was too polite NOT to buy anything, since most them were already very much into the scene of massive Sephora hauls or monthly subscription box self-care. I think my wife bought like a $20 moisturizer that she used on me."

He finally got around to telling me he wanted me to become his ""partner"" in his MLM scheme. This was like 30 years ago. It was an Amway pitch.

And she also was lured in by the ""community"" and ""friends"" because they tell you in their huge rallies that you're surrounded by your new life long friends. Everyone smile and meet each other.

We were staying at her place. She was the model target, young mother who didn't want to work outside of the house. Hopelessly naive. 

The really awkward part is that it was right in the morning, and I hadn't had any coffee or really woke up yet. 

So, I come downstairs and the whole family is sitting around the living room, and they're all drinking these weird off-brand energy drinks. So, being still asleep, I just assumed this was something they were into, and so she starts talking them up and showing me the different flavors and all that. 

I looked them over and said 'Can I just make a pot of regular coffee? I'm not really into energy drinks.' 

My wife sort of mumbled 'She's selling them ...' under her breath and I had an even weirder moment to process where I thought she wanted me to buy drinks she bought at the store from her? 

I got up and made coffee, and during that process, she'd gone on with her pitch and it dawned on me that she'd bought something like 100 cases of this crap and now had to offload it, and hopefully sign people up to sell it as well. 

It was just sad, and I felt bad for making it worse."

After that the couple had a huge fight and she shattered the screen on his plasma TV (he was really proud of it). The cops were called and we all had to go home.

Me being very green I didn't get a lot of replies, so I was naturally excited to get invited to a ""job interview"". I forget what they said they did exactly, but I imagine it was designed to be vague enough to get me there.

Once there the other shoe dropped pretty quickly. There were a bunch of balding ""CEO type"" business men talking about some powdered energy drink and how it had changed their life. I sat through their presentation for some reason and made my exit quickly after. They kept hounding me over the phone for a couple of days, saying they ""really saw something special in me"", before giving up.

He tried to get me on board and just for shits, I actually did call the guy running the scam-- damn if he didn't sound like every single fast-talking shyster you've seen in a movie. Slick, snobbish and made sure to tell me about his motorcycle and his convertible. All from selling energy drinks, I guess. I had purchased one-- it was expensive and it tasted like shit!

So they came over and tried to sign us up to sell frigging AMWAY!  We were captive in our own house!

* 1 million independent business owners!

Wow, impressive numbers!... hang on.... That's an average of $1,000 per year. And that's revenue. If we be generous and assume you make 20% profit and spend only an hour a week on the ""business"", you're earning less than $4/hour. 

And that's average. We are shown stories of people earning thousands of dollars per month. That just drags the median way down.

lxrmud2,"I'm so disheartened with how bad the education system in America is. I have had to explain basic math concepts to people who have grown up connected to the internet their entire lives and could have easily just taught themselves and they just haven't. I once worked at a business  that used part-time teens for basic labor tasks and I had to stop the teen employees multiple times from giving someone a 90% discount when they meant 10% several times. We kept a calculator right there on the counter, but a few didn't know how to use it. I taught several people who were nearly grown adults with driver's licenses how to use a calculator to do basic math. 

For the curve-ball out of left field, I quit that job because one of the managers, a creepy hobbit looking dude in his 30's, was sleeping with a 17-year-old employee, which isn't illegal in our state because the age of consent is 17, but it creeped me the fuck out that nobody else had a problem with it, so I quit."

lxqmn3l,"You're overcomplicating it. It was meant to be two sentences. ""Was"" *is* correct, because it is referring to the *singular* concept of ""improper fractions"". ""That is"" is an idiom, an abbreviated form of the phrase ""that is to say"", which would normally be offset from the rest of the sentence with a comma or a colon. It means that whatever follows is a more precise expression of whatever was just said.

~~Agreed about the double negative.~~ Never mind, see below!

~~Fix the double negative,~~ expand the idiom, and you get this:

That any clearer?"
lxqp238,">     That is to say, half of America can't deal with ""solving"" improper fractions.

You changed the meaning. The point was that the people can't deal with leaving an improper fraction ""unsolved"". That's what the purpose of the ""not"" was before ""solving""."
lxqt52v,"Ah, I see. On that particular point I had been agreeing with the person I replied to that there was likely a double-negative in there, because it had seemed to me that the comment was trying to say that half the population can't solve improper fractions.

Humans aren't really made to understand magnitude. You ever do that silly thought experiment, where someone asks you if you would take a one month job, at 1¢ on day one, if the money doubled every day? Many people don't understand that on day 30 alone, you would be paid $5+ mil, let alone what you add to it from previous days. I think it totals to ~$11 mil.

They got groups of us to meet in a library to talk about it and when I started asking questions she pulled me aside and asked me to leave. My girlfriend at the time got wrapped up in it without me knowing it was the same thing at the time and had a horrible experience. They had her travel on her own halfway across the US with ""alumni housing"" so someone else who was suckered into it. And the expectation she would find housing. It was considered sales though, because you didn't buy the product first. You know, they just isolate you from your family and friends so this is the only thing you have to do with your free time in the summer. Well the kicker is, she wasn't allowed to sell in suburban neighborhoods, which are the only place I feel like that crap would sell. So I think instead of the $10k she thought she was going to make she was out like $800 in car repairs for driving a piece of junk that far, and whatever gas was required."

But then so was a pound. 

But I'm not stupid. I crossed the top name off, added my own name and sent the letter to 20 friends. Top guy would still receive £7999 so I doubt he's GaF about mine.

And nothing came in the post for me. Not a single person sent me a pound.

3 generations is 8000
4 generations is 160000
5 generations is 3200000
6 generations is 64,000,000 people (UK population).

7 generations is 1.2B people.

lxq4p95,"Ye, I got roped into a Hover vacuum's recruitment session. The guy spent about 1min talking about it being sales, then did his sales pitch for the vacume, kinda sold me on it being a good product. Then we took a break, he tried to talk to me and one other person... guess we paid the most attention or whatever. So, me and her end up out in the parking lot ""smoking""... but not smoking. We both agreed to it being shady and way over priced went to lunch together, and then never talked again"
lxq4w7g,"Hey, Amway made a lot of people very rich. But you need a warm market. You need to be liked and respected and charismatic. You need to be a good salesperson. I was none of those. It wasn't Amway but I tried it and I failed. What a f****** waste of time."
lxt0gb8,"Similar story: 1998 and I was a 20yo walking around the Houston Auto Show. Approached by some rando while looking at the cars.

Anyway, two weeks later I’m in a packed ballroom at the West Loop Marriott in Houston’s Galleria neighborhood attending an (drumroll please) Amway presentation. Ohhhhh I was pissed.

Thankfully, even at 20, I knew Amway was a scam and declined."
lxtytoy,One terrible job I had right out of college (yes it was hard back then to get a job right out of college just like now) the sales manager had like 30 burner phones and would answer each one with a different name.

lxrrqxm,"Do they think all their friends are too stupid to know they're just copying and pasting whatever the company told them to copy and paste?

lxql0jq,yes I have heard that statement from my mother
lxskjn0,It’s all about the spin
lxpnkby,"One issue I’ve seen is that there are some legitimate brands that make good products but still do this stupid MLM setup. 

My kids favorite books are from a company called Usborne. They make some really cute books but they do the whole “buy from a consultant model” and they are happy to give you information on how to sell it your self. 

Cutco is another example. The knives are decent from what I’m told (they even sell them at Costco) but I was heavily pressured to become a consultant by another friend I knew in college. 

If you remember the P90X workout program that was popular in the early 2010s it also was sold by an MLM. 

In none of those instances would I call the products bad or scams but the business model absolutely is."
lxq2ufh,"> In none of those instances would I call the products bad or scams but the business model absolutely is.

Makes one wonder if they ran the numbers and determined that the product would flop (lack of advertising/word of mouth) without this level of forced marketing."
lxqmzbx,"Cutco knives fucking rule. The model doesn't.

Back when my brother was in high school a few of his friend's ended up working for Cutco. My mom brought a few steak knife steaks from a few of them to give as wedding favors. Helped some of them reach their goals. Helped my mom not have to think about future wedding gifts for nieces and nephews. Not a bad win/win scenario."
lxpjxnu,“How can it be a pyramid scheme when the item I’m selling is shaped like a box?”
lxpprb0,They are trained to basically deflect such evidence despite the fact that their own website has accurate data of how much most people… DO NOT MAKE!

lxpra9e,As someone who from time to time drinks herbalife. I can tell you that now they are making it sneakier to sell that stuff under different disguises such as trying to get in the “Starbucks/boba tea” trends. They would never say it’s herbalife and avoid at all costs. One main reason they are doing this because the product is so over price and a lot of long time customers starting finding dupes for it .

Before everyone he had a cell phone with free long distance, long distance phone plans were a competitive business and made it into MLM.

I went to the dentist and while the tech was doing my cleaning she asks, ""So are the you happy with your long distance plan?"""
lxplpiy,"I do believe I may have been involved with that, if it was in the 90s. (around 97/98) 

My father's business partner sold him on some Long Distance MLM scheme and then he paid all the fees to get me involved with it. Total scam. They charged _more_ than all the competition and we were supposed to guilt trip people into paying more to help us out. Like, we were supposed to _really_ lay on the guilt trip tactics. (""So you'd rather let me fail than pay a few cents more per minute than you do now?"" To which my mother said, ""Yes, absolutely. You're trying to sell me an inferior product. You _should_ fail."")

lxpfmx0,"I had a coworker who got a call from her son’s doctor shortly after her son was in for a checkup. The doctor wanted to stop by their house one evening soon. They said sure, thinking the labs showed the worst result imaginable. Turns out the worst was a MLM scheme. Seriously!"

I will say though my one friend is one of the “top” sellers and did get the free Mercedes and all the trips and makes $250k a year… but she has to hustle and it has taken her 10 years.
lxp6rgr,She probably had to fuck over hundreds of SAHMs too
lxp902n,And by “top” sells you mean top scammers lol
lxpghkx,[deleted]
lxqwa48,"When I was looking for a job, my sister-in-law tried to pull me into a pyramid scheme for I think Arbonne too. She framed it as something related to my field and even said the name of the company was whatever her “team’s” name was so I wouldn’t catch on right away. 

But she wouldn’t answer questions straight, and her responses sounded like they were out of some guidebook. My guard was down at first because it was my sister-in-law… but after some back and forth I figured it out and told her absolutely not and she should be careful with this scheme. 

She never brought it up again and for whatever reason doesn’t sell for them anymore. But I will never forget that when I was vulnerable and in need of a job, she tried to exploit me for money."
lxpfrzp,Arbonne and Monat!
lxq8y82,They do a very good face scrub. I have a friend who was selling that and the way they make money is by getting other people to sell it under them and so on. so you’re constantly having to try to talk other people into investing in the company. once you get one set of employees underneath you and they start getting their employees. The idea is that you make money and never have to sell another product. She hasn’t gotten there yet. It’s been four years.
lxrktc0,"The thing they don't tell you about the Mercedes is that it's a lease, and they pay the lease, as long as you meet your goals. If you ever fail to meet the goals, oops, you're on the hook for those Mercedes payments."
lxs9sr1,Hahaha I didn’t know that. She doesn’t have the Mercedes anymore and I did hear through the grapevine she wasn’t making as much as recent years lol.
lxsby7h,"Yup, just another method to control them. Once they're stuck with that lease, they'll do anything to keep those payments coming, including buying extra product themselves under the illusion that they'll somehow sell it. Whenever you see one of thesw idiots on Facebook offering discounts on stuff, more likely than but they bought extra product to preserve their level/tier."

lxpbj8t,Have you seen the documentary LuLaRich? It's really good. MLMs are awful
lxpfis3,"The TV series *On Becoming a God in Central Florida* may be a dark comedy, but it does a fabulous job of showing what is motivating people to get sucked into pyramid schemes. I think we have been brainwashed by the idea that we all should aspire to own our own businesses, and MLM schemes look like a sure-fire way to do that. (Also a lot of people try to buy franchises, which don’t always work out either.) A couple of generations ago you could easily get a job with decent pay and benefits, but those days are long gone."
lyfnren,Yeah I think lularoe helped expose every other mlm (minus Tupperware because I still love it and you can buy from the site lol) .
lxpd8g0,I love the response of “it’s not a pyramid scheme. Those are illegal.” Well smoking is legal and it still kills people. Being legal doesn’t make it right. You just found a workaround.

One day she comes in all excited about a possible job offer she got in the mail.  That alone made me suspicious, so I asked to see what she'd gotten.  She showed me the letter and I started poring over it, lots of promises of flexible hours to work around school schedules and extra money to put towards college, but very little actual info...until finally, near the bottom, I saw it: Vector Marketing.

*It was fucking Cutco Knives.*

I immediately told her to avoid that ""job offer"" and any others like it."

lxp50xt,My mom loves them and just refuses to believe any MLM she gets involved with counts as an MLM
lxp77ni,"Even things that aren't considered MLM's but definitely fit under the pyramid scheme along with MLM's. My favorite is the book exchange that comes along every Christmas that I try to warn people away from by letting them know it's a pyramid scheme and is illegal.

Last year I had someone argue that it wasn't a pyramid scheme and it was ""just for fun"" and I didn't have to participate. I mean, I definitely won't, but if people at the top get all the books and the people at the bottom get zero, that's super scammy and super scummy.

If any one pyramid scheme/MLM worked the way it's set up to work and each of your four friends recruit their four friends and so on (or however many, I don't have the exact info readily available), you only get to 13 levels before you exceed the population of the entire world."

lxozj1l,This right here is the answer.
lxpfler,"The interesting thing is some of them make legitimately good products, but the whole MLM scam makes people not want them. My neighbor is an older lady who works as an assistant at a big university's law school. She makes all her salary that way. She knows people her age that were huge into Amway and she technically ""joined"" but all she does is buy products for herself and as gifts. I've received plenty of good personal care products (shaving cream, etc) that were awesome, as gifts from her. She knows MLM's are stupid, but if you can get the products for yourself ""wholesale"" why not I guess?

Similarly my mom bought a Cutco slotted spoon in the mid 90's from our babsitter's boyfriend who was roped into their sales stuff. I guess it's technically an MLM? (aka Vector Marketing). Was an awesome slotted spoon and she still has it 30 years later. Good product, crappy sales tactics."
lxpgumm,My wife was interested in joining one. Her sisters do it and peer pressure is high obviously. I said no probably a dozen times and did my best to educate her but I finally let her try. She didn’t even last the training session because of how scummy it sounded
lxpkew9,"I know someone who thinks MLMs are the greatest money making scheme there is.

They've been through several of them and spent thousands only to get nothing and fail. every time. Yet they keep doing them, saying they're _doing it right_ this time and going to become a millionaire. (They 100% blame themselves for all the failures, saying it's their fault.)

It's like... you've done probably half a dozen MLMs so far and every single one has failed and lost you _thousands_ per attempt. Why the fuck do you keep doing this?!"
lxpqwx4,"I was invited to an MLM event by a former coworker (he just said to come to his place for a bbq), and had to sit there and listen to someone talk about their health supplement MLM company for an hour. I stayed, cos bbq. I actually found it quite an interesting experience because some of the techniques used appear lifted straight from the televangelist playbook (or maybe it’s the other way round, who knows who copied who). It was exceedingly predatory behaviour. It really felt like a cult group without the religious trappings.

I said “this is very interesting but I’d like some evidence for your claims. Like actual peer reviewed evidence please”. They promised they’d get back to me with all this evidence they had. They never did."
lxput43,"What's worse is that they made a law against pyramid schemes, but apparently renaming the scam is enough to get around the law."
lxpyf9v,"Lost one of my best friends to one of these. In her wedding and everything. Kept in touch after college. I knew she was doing MLM stuff, but she never bugged me about it until one day... she asked me (m) about my skincare routine. I told her I didn't have one, and I wasn't interested, so please stop there. She texted me every couple hours about her product for the next week, until I blocked her number and socials. Tried talking to her about it about a year later, and her response text was to ask me if I was ready to change my mind about her product. That shit consumes people. "
lxq12ca,"This. It's despicable how they prey on people - I have a friend who's $14k into debt in one (the water one), she's a single mom and has full belief she'll see a return on the money she spent. It's absolutely a scam and I have to remain quiet about it because I value our friendship. But I was dismayed to learn she'd taken out *loans* for it."
lxrir9q,"I'm a debt specialist and unfortunately I've been seeing people like her asking for help after they've accumulated so much debt that they can no longer even make the minimums anymore. It's really sad to see. 

What is even worse is that I can't even help some of these people, and bankruptcy ends up being their only option. The reason being is that they end up sinking SO much into these scams that their debt to income ratio is far too high to be approved for any loans, THEN they go to these disgusting predatory loan companies with 1000%+ interest(yes you read that right, 1000%). For example, I saw one last week that the guy borrowed $1,200(ironically to pay off another predatory loan lol) and it was 25 WEEKLY payments. At the end he'd have paid almost $36k. Doesn't sound legal, but there are loopholes that allow them. 

The reason we can't help is because these predatory loan companies will make the loan term less than the federal minimum allowed to enter into any consolidation programs. So their only route is to go the bankruptcy route. Most of them won't even qualify for chapter 7 either due to their spouse making too much. It's sad. So many starting these with credit cards and will never, never make a profit."
lxrm4ho,"I almost fell for one last week. They were tricky. It was a real office building, with real people making real money, working six days a week, for over twelve hours a day, calling themselves sales, with a large “pump up” meeting every morning, everyone had worked there for 2 days to 4 weeks aside from the five core team members presenting at the meetings, and we were fed lunch every day. I get excited during interviews and tend to not ask questions so halfway through training I realized I wasn’t getting paid and left without intention of coming back. 

The mlm was in how they were hiring “team members” so that the “team leaders” could get promoted. One of the most successful guys there was talking about how you find someone who hates their job and recruit them underneath you.

(Also, I am super into early sobriety and could tell this is the kind of environment that would cause me to relapse immediately.)"

I remember someone came from this one called WorldVentures (relaunched in recent years as DreamTrips)

When I found out about how said membership cost, my eyes went wide and I immediately called WV up to get out of it because I wasn't about that

Heck, even when I texted some of my friends about it to try to get them to sign up, one of them even caught on and could smell a scam"

lxpc6yl,"My mom had a good friend whose daughter got into Herbalife at the bottom and rose in the ranks to live very lavishly. She became one of the top people on the pyramid. However, she was never the sharpest tool in the shed, and one time on a flight she told the guy sitting next to her how wealthy she was. He took a great interest in her story and asked her out. Long story short, he was a grifter with multiple ex-wives and numerous children. He failed to share that info with her until after she foolishly married him without a pre nup. After a few years he filed for divorce and she had to part with several million in the settlement. But the story doesn’t end there. He was murdered by one of his ex-wives and my Herbalife connection sued his family to get her money back claiming she and the grifter were never legally married because his previous divorce had never been finalized. Ultimately the judge ruled against her and the last time I saw her she was on the local news  crying outside the courthouse. What an idiot."

lxpglw8,"For my latinos theres a ""life coaching"" group called ""Top Lider""  and it's 100% a pyramid scheme. They take your cash and give you the most basic advise, the kind of stuff you hear on those cringe tiktoks. A good friend of mine fell for it and right when he joined they asked him and all new members to each ask their family members for $20 but don't tell them what it's for. Turns out they just all used it to have lunch toguether and discuss the next level where they had to pay $300 to learn, the prices went up as the levels increased. They had everyone wear white like a cult and they had him shave his bread which is something he had always swore he would never do. I honestly didn't care until he started to reach out to all his female family members to get them to join, that shit is creepy.

Top Líder is a cult/pirámide scheme"

lxq8r2z,"One time I was invited to an MLM party. It felt so overwhelming since everyone is ""rich"" and they point at one person and whispering you know he bought his first ""branded"" car. 


I didn't pursue that because I was thinking I will burden the people I know to buy the things I'll be selling. And honestly, if I kept on selling to the same people what will be the timing, every month? So I thought with my personality and the math, this won't work for me. So I ghosted them after that."

We set up a time for a call a week later as I assumed he was starting a real business and wanted advice, but he immediately started pitching me on his MLM which as Amway is disguise. At first he denied it was an MLM or Amway until I sent him the links that show the two companies are the same.

Hung up and never spoke to him again."
lxr2rq4,"Some of those have been running for so long, my mom and  grandmother both have stories about being invited to what they thought was a 'welcome to the neighborhood ' parties, only for is to be mlm pitches. I think Tupperware, and one of the cleaning ones. 

Now for me it's changed to 'old friend on Facebook who you think wants to catch up'-nope it's just a Scentsy pitch."
lxr3ij7,"They have gotten a lot better at conditioning the victims in these. An acquittance got suckered in and it was interesting to observe the whole thing in a sad, train wreck kind of a way. Apparently the very first thing they did was to sell her the idea that everyone around her giving negative feedback was extremely envious of her impending riches and needed to be 'dealt with'. She became extremely defensive to any advice that the artisan soap she was supposed to start selling wasn't going to be a huge sales success and the mandatory, paid classes she had to take and the noticeable inventory purchases were just going to be left rotting in her home. She tried to run the business as the kind where she's personally dependent on the business' loans and to the shock to no one, completely ruined her personal economy. Naturally before this she also ruined her social life with the whole 'you don't need to find customers, your friends will be the first customers' thinking."
lxr3iyo,"My mom fell victim to this in the 1980s, so these have been around a very long time. I remember Amway and Avon. She had at least $10,000 of inventory at our house when I cleaned it out last year  (alzheimer's). Probably double or triple that but I can't bring myself to say it.

I thought that sounded nice so I filled out my info. A day or so later I got a call that I had won and could bring one guest. I chose to take my sister with me.


We arrived at the location and it was a *Mary Kay event*. And I started to recognize faces from the cafe; I think every woman was told she ""won"". They tricked us all into going to this sample party. We all got to test products then a form was passed around to order things and separately to sign up to sell MK products. We left and I apologized to my sister but all we could do was laugh about how ridiculous it is. In hindsight it doesn't even feel real."

The entire time he was talking about the money I could make from the people ""below me."" When I asked what they sell he said something to the effect of ""we sell everything from cars to toilet paper but it doesn't matter what we sell."" That's when I knew I wasn't going to join up.  I let him finish his pitch and got out as quickly as possible."
lxreacz,I also read an article about how women with high degrees - Masters and doctorates - who choose to become mothers and choose to stay home feel unproductive and get sucked into MLMs because they feel like it’s something they can do to contribute. I know it applies to a friend of mine who got her doctorate.
lxrfvm8,You should go watch the show “On Becoming a God in Central Florida” on Apple TV or prime. It’s hilarious and it shows how they pull people in.
lxrhyd5,"I had a sad/weird experience with an MLM pitch. I had just moved into a new home post divorce and didn't know anyone in the area. This lovely woman came over with two boys were similar ages as my boys to deliver a warm banana nut bread to welcome us to the neighborhood and introduce the kids. My sons were at their Dads so we just chit chatted while her sons enjoyed my kids' playroom. I thought I had just met a friend with kids and was so happy! Things were looking up! My kids come home and are very upset that every one of their lego sets were dismantled in their playroom. Totally my fault there - I was enjoying my new friend's company so much neither of us were closely watching the kids. 

Flash forward to a few weeks later she comes by to have the kids play and my kids are a little weirded out by the Lego destroyers coming over but they all go to the playroom to play anyway. Me and 'new friend' start chatting and she starts a damn MLM schpeal. I'm like NOPE almost immediately but her schpeal included her ability to WATCH OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS for $$ while she also works her MLM. So this B is in my house with RANDOM KIDS trying to get me to join her downline. It hit me harder than it probably should because I was in such a vulnerable time period post-divorce. I wanted to kill her with my bare hands. And I couldn't help but think about these kids' parents who couldn't possibly have known that their kids were in random homes being used as pawns to gain entry so their babysitter could promote an MLM !!"
lxrlv2z,I lost so many friends telling them they're stupid as fuck doing vemma. They had multiple meetings i attended all of them and begged them not to do it trying to explain to them what a pyramid scheme is. They all lost a bunch of money. They apologized and now come to me when it comes to investing. Lmao.
lxrq5lw,"I went to a couple ""interviews"" for some MLM's when I was like 20-23...thisbwas circa 2007-2010 when mlm's were still a little newer and not as known. I hate those people with a passion."
lxrsetc,"Yes! In high school I got sucked into one selling fucking kitchen knives. Idk why I did it. I hate talking to people, I hate phone calls, don't care about cutlery. I made most of my extended family sit with me in their homes and go over a awful, awkward presentation. Also involved my cutting a penny in half with the scissors. Like twice a week after school we had to do group meetings with other reps, all very young. Where we would bust out our phones and they would make us call a set amount of people to get appointments, and if they didn't want to do it we had to see if they had any friends that would be interested.
As an introverted weird girl I lasted 2 weeks .  Maybe. 
OMG. I can't. I think I developed a new PTSD trigger. Fuck you cutco. 
*They do have very nice knives and I still have my demo set decades later.... But. Horrible. Not even sure I got paid properly."
lxrwu81,"They're so crazy. It's a commission only sales job, which very few people will enjoy or succeed at. Sales jobs are the ultimate grind, it really takes a certain personality to take constant rejection and keep hitting doors/making calls. There's no overlap there with the kind of people who see MLMs as a way to make bank with little effort.

I know one person who does it and seems to make money, but she's an absolute shark of a salesperson. Her day job is selling UPCs to datacenters for Eaton and she makes bank doing that. No idea why she also hawks the shitty essential oils. I think she's just addicted to sales."
lxpaupn,"I once almost got caught in Primerica for a minute. I just graduated from high school, never had a job before and never heard of MLMs or pyramid schemes before so I had no knowledge or warning. This was also in the early days of the Internet before you could just Google everything. Then a friend of mine later roped me into Amway before I left that as well."

lxq2u6t,Ahhh a German influencer even made a video about it go viral & had a whole law fight with a specific company (bc he had called them specifically out)
lxq84w1,"About 8 years ago, when I first started working at a school (elementary at the time), one of the teachers was pushing Herbalife crap. A bunch of the other ones bought in and became part of her down line, and I would see many pictures of her “team” on Facebook. I always wondered if she (and the others) were idiots, or just insanely malicious."
lxqgeam,"The question to always ask yourself, not only with MLMs but with any sales or business proposal is ""Why is this person telling me this, and what's in it for them?""

There are lots of schemes where somebody just wants to ""help"" you make money, whether its investing in real estate, stock advice or whatever else – but if they're sitting on this cool new way of making a profit, what's the sense in sharing it? 

If I'm sitting on this super-undervalued share which I know is going to skyrocket, why the hell would I be telling anybody else about it? I'd be doing all I can do collect and borrow as much capital as I can to buy the share while it's cheap and avoid driving the price up by telling others...unless that's exactly what my goal is. 

There has to be a transparency to any type of transaction. It's not that stock advice is necessarily bad, but what they get out of it has to be obvious – whether it's a set fee as an advisor or a paid subscription. That of course doesn't automatically qualify it as honest, but when somebody is doing you a favor out of the goodness of their hearts, that's a red flag."
lxqjl96,"I went to some employment orientation that was just a MLM scheme and felt super uncomfortable about it. I got up to leave and they asked me where I was going, I said ""bathroom"" and was put on the spot about it. I basically was like ""this job isn't for me"" and left for the parking lot immediately."
lxqs7zt,Because they think they can make money doing minimal work and desperately want it to be true
lxqtb7w,Unfortunately my uncle made bank being in one and it's legitimized it as a viable money making venture to his siblings. My mum has done a couple including my uncles' one and has had nothing come from it. They don't see the fact that you need to step on people to get ahead.

lxqwj42,I've got a friend going through an acrimonious divorce/asset division who is shilling what is so obviously an mlm. I tried politely declining when she tried to recruit me and she said she was surprised that someone as big on self improvement as I am is turning down such an amazing wealth building opportunity.
lxr1des,"Imagine you’re burnt out and at your wits end with no employment prospects. You know internally you have a 2% chance you’ll actually make money and get nothing but positive reinforcements on your “work.”

I can imagine suspending disbelief if I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs with no offers"
lxrab8y,"Well, in all fairness they’re not marketed as MLMs or pyramid schemes…they’re usually sold as an “opportunity to work for yourself and make tons of money!”

lxtxzqi,"Some of them are even worse where they do enough digging on the person they want to scam, find places they lived, and then fake that they are someone that lived in that area who knew of them, complete with pics of the person pulled from facebook. It's always a love scam, and always targeting someone who is elderly posting about their health conditions (especially mental health).

I intercepted one with my brother in law's mother and the texts went back for weeks of the scammer claiming to have done work on her old house she lived in years ago and had been in love with her ever since, now he was rich and working overseas and just needed someone to wire him money to get back to the states and marry her and take care of her. The amount of prep the scammer went through before the ask was amazing. Pretty sure that went we realized what was up (she was keeping it a secret from everyone else in the house, just like they asked her to) she was about to wire the money. I pretended to be her in the messaging and said that I wasn't sure about marrying him, unless he was willing to get pegged. Can't marry a man who wasn't willing to take it in the pooper with a strap-on. Scammer eventually realized he wasn't talking to an old woman anymore (which took him over an hour) and just started spamming expletives. Probably a solid months worth of work on their end, down the drain."

Why anyone with an advanced degree in a competitive field would fall for this is beyond me, but the roommate called up their grandparents to borrow some of the money to pay it and several people contributed to the $25k that they actually then sent, per the instructions. There was never any proof of why there would be so much in back taxes and I don’t think this person had a career that would have paid anything large because we were all students + working at the time. 

I’m also not sure why they were worried about the FBI as if they were going to be sent away without even so much as a payment plan or garnished wages being on the table first. Crazy. Also, who has family wealthy enough that they could cobble together $25k from a handful of people in days and NO ONE questioned it??? "

Wish I had that family, damn."
lxq1htz,"Well, boy oh boy are you in luck, because my name happens to be IRS and YOU, my friend, owe me 25,000 dollars that need to be paid within X amount of days, or the FBI will take you away without warning. Please have the 25,000 sent in various forms of various gift cards and sent to me, IRS as soon as possible. Thanks!
//IRS"
lxp7xqw,If I asked my dad for $10 he would ask me why I needed it. He would probably give it to me regardless but he would ask. 
lxrxzy9,"I'm not your family, but I can get you $25k tomorrow! Just gonna need $1k for the transfer fees - can you mail that?"
lxqfxef,"Wouldn't you prefer a family that questioned it, kept your money safe, and explained the situation to you?"
lxr0bcr,"No, I'll use their money to buy cocaine."
lxutrqg,"The kind of family that *really* doesn't want the FBI knocking, I guess."
lxp6xj9,Fun fact: the IRS does not make phone calls. All of their communication is through snail mail.
lxp7ryf,Yeah and they will never collect money via randomly mailed gift cards because that is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. The govt is the one who produces money??? Why do they need untraceable gift cards? People should face some kind of penalty like community service for being dumb enough to fall for this sort of thing. 
lxqce47,They've already been punished for falling for it. Maybe banks who are alerted to this should run anti fraud classes in exchange for refunding the money?
lxrmoik,"To their credit, I have heard of retail chains where if people come in buying large amounts of gift cards, they recognize the red flag and try to explain to the person that if they are buying the gift cards to pay some debt, no legitimate organization accepts payment in gift cards.

As I understand it, it doesn't always work."
lxsob2f,Pretty much every big box store in my area has signs near the gift cards explaining the scams and warning the IRS does not ask for gift cards for payment.
lxr3np2,"If you're not able to identify that the 25K the ""IRS"" asked you to post to a random residential address is a scam then I'm not sure what an anti-fraud class is going to do for you."
lxr2mbr,"To be fair, it doesn't help that [IRS hinders cash payments](https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2023/04/10/i-tried-to-pay-my-taxes-in-cash-heres-what-happened/) almost maliciously."
lxrpwg9,"In Canada, we can pay income taxes at any post office, including in cash, but like this article states, there is a limit (I think on some quick googling that it's also $1,000, though I don't know if that's per-payment/day, or an annual total). There is also a service fee based on the amount.

The bottom line, however, is that it is easier to pay in other ways, but not so much easier that it's a farce. If you have cash, get a bank account, put it into your bank account, and pay your taxes directly from your bank account. Or write a cheque. Or get a bank draft. Or use a credit or debit card.

I have never tried to pay my electric or gas or property tax bill in cash either, but I expect that's similarly difficult.

But there's a difference between ""refusing"" cash, and ""discouraging"" cash or cash simply being inconvenient to pay. And there's a difference between recommending a credit card or direct payment through your bank compared to recommending ""gift cards"", which is not a method of payment that any legitimate entity accepts as a form of payment (other than the company the card is for).

Now, I suppose if they were asking you to buy like... those instant prepaid visa/mastercard ""gift cards"", that might be another story and might drift into surface plausibility - but my understanding is they more commonly are asking for retail gift cards like Amazon or Best Buy or whatever.


Edit: The article's punchline of:

>For people without bank accounts, their only option for paying taxes shouldn’t require paying fees to credit card processors or retailers – especially since they are likely among the poorest taxpayers.

Is somewhat valid, but the article's complaint with retailers accepting cash tax payments was not the fees, but the difficulty:

>The IRS also has partnered with national chains like CVS, Walgreens, 7-Eleven and Family Dollar to accept cash on its behalf. Their service fees are less, either $1.50 or $2.50 per payment. However, the steps needed to navigate the online program before you can show up at a retailer seemed almost as difficult as filling in the tax forms.

Paying $1.50 or $2.50 as a convenience fee to pay your annual taxes, even for the 'poorest taxpayers' is simply not large enough to be relevant. The difficulty in the steps needed to do it seems like the bigger problem."
lxrhrte,">People should face some kind of penalty like community service for being dumb enough to fall for this sort of thing. 

I love it! Introduce some shame to the equation!

*Your intelligence is bad, and you should feel bad, too!*"
lxsvvn0,"I'm am so waiting for the IRS call again so I can ask if the cards should be sent to Ogden, Ohio or Cincinnati, Utah.  I want to see if they catch the state switch."
lxq75kr,"This is probably true 99% of the cases but if you're weird enough of a case, they will actually call. As a matter of fact, so does the SSA. But it won't be out of the blue, something must have been set in motion already beforehand. Source: I was called by the IRS and SSA, and in both cases it was about something very specific."
lxr9d99,"They'll never call you _out of the blue_ is the point. When the IRS calls you, it's part of something that's already happening -- meaning you've got an ongoing case with them in some way. You've opened it yourself, or they've sent you a lot of mail already about it and _now_ they're calling you.

They will never threaten jail over the phone, nor will they accept any form of payment other than the standard check/wire-transfer type instrument."
lxskoq6,SSA scheduled a call with my dad to discuss my late mother's SSA payments. I was still sketched out about it knowing that he is older and has previously fallen for the giftcard scam. Luckily this one was all legit.
lxqq9dq,"The amount of people who don't understand this very basic thing with a lot of scams. My Gf nearly fell for one, luckily I was there when it happened. Had a buddy get a call from Windows, saying his computer was having some security issues. Took way longer to convince him it was a scam, because 1 why in the hell would they work for Windows... the operating system, not Microsoft? 2 and this is the really mind bogling part his only computer was a goddam Mac Book. Why the fuck would Windows be calling about your Apple product?"
lxr9kpu,"And number 3, why would Microsoft ever monitor your computer to the point where they can tell you're ""having security issues"" but also be unable to do anything about them without you installing some sketchy 3rd-party tool?"
lxpym07,Yup. And if you ignore the paper long enough they just start garnishing your wages.
lxqtfdk,"I worked for the IRS. The only time the IRS will call you if you have a Taxpayer Advocate assigned to a tax matter. Any other instance, the IRS mails correspondences due to this particular reason."
lxrw3vx,"Yup. IRS will never call. Snail mail with one piece of identifying info such as a part of your tax id or last four of social.

Now there are clones of snail mail minus this one piece of info, and it’s the only way to tell real from fake."
lxtih1i,"I feel bad for elderly people the most. These scammers know what they’re doing when they target them. They’re much less likely to be up to date on the current methods used to get their money. My mom is 67, and although she’s fairly tech savvy for her age, I still fill her in any time I hear of a new method."
lxsvnj4,The IRS does call *after* snail mail communications and an appointment is set up on a particular day and time with a named agent.  So yes there are calls but you have a stack of paperwork to look through before it actually happens.
lxti0ii,Ok. Theyre never gonna call and say you have to send them Walmart and iTunes gift cards to avoid immediate arrest. That better?
lxp7u2i,Also in order to have 25k in back taxes you would have had to pay zero taxes on like 100k in income?? Idk about you but most college kids are clearing that kind of income
lxp8rll,"The big question I had about the whole thing was why they never followed up to ask for help from any of the dozens of resources they could have used, and why they felt like the threat of law enforcement was serious. Now, I imagine they must have been into some recreational drug use or something kinda shady. Maybe they were worried about their career options if they were hoping to work for the govt in the future, but still. "
lxrafcy,"Fear of authority is drummed into people pretty hard all the way through college. And often beyond, depending on the kind of workplaces they're in. I know plenty of people in their 50s who are still terrified of even lightly questioning their boss about obvious errors, because they think they'll be loudly and publicly fired over it.

And because there _are_ some petty authoritarians out there, it reinforces the idea that it's a risk most people have to be aware of."
lxpyqwm,Closer to 200k.
lxr9wnv,"It's possible to have back taxes kind of balloon, though. Happened to a friend where they made a pretty serious filing error 3 years in a row (not declaring income from a side hustle) -- actual _tax_ owed was about $10k total, but with all the penalties and interest it was quite a bit more."
lxrfnxe,"I know people who have been in a similar situation and they wound up taking out a personal loan to pay it. FYI to a lot of people, the govt will often allow you to do payment plans for things if you owe them a lot of money. Not always, but there are a lot of options for that sort of thing. 

This person should have known they in no way would have been obligated to pay this much for anything because they weren’t making much money, unless they were profiting from something illegal/off the books. "
lxrlkmc,"100% - the IRS can be scary if you're actually doing criminal tax evasion. But otherwise, they genuinely will want to work with you to come correct. 

I've had businesses with very complicated tax situations, messed it up to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and had the IRS waive penalties and interest when I made it clear that I wanted to do the legal thing but just misunderstood. They helped me figure out what the right thing was and set up a payment plan and everything."
ly1bxw4,"Ya the IRS isn’t as scary as they want you to think they are understaffed and their lawyers are under payed, my uncles best friend has a back tax deal with them that he has to live to 135 to pay off lol"
ly4mkc8,"If he owns property, they’ll take it at the time of his death. He may have something in the agreement that says he can’t sell it or put it in a trust without the IRS first taking their share. If he doesn’t own property, the IRS probably just knows it’s not worth trying to pursue him if he’s mostly making payments, unless they’re garnishing his wages. "
lxq45zl,"My mom once called me in a panic because the “IRS” called her and said they’d be sending police to the house to arrest me (I think I was about 38 at the time, hadn’t lived at home in years) and even though it made no sense she thought it was real. Luckily she called me directly to check before doing anything else."

lxp6vdd, Could have bought a fucking house
lxpwz52,Just because people can regurgitate information on que doesn't mean they're smart.
lxq2npt,I mean plenty of people have that kind of money but usually it would come with the brains to question it 
lxqm7yp,"The reason these scams work is because a large percentage of people (especially college kids) have never been on the business end of law enforcement so they don’t know what to expect.  If you’ve never gotten a threatening letter from the IRS because you forgot to send in your W-2 with your return (they threatened me with tax fraud charges unless I sent a corrected return stating I had 0 income and was entitled to no refund, or, in very fine print, I could also send in the form W-2 and have my return processed as-is) or something you don’t know how they operate. "

lxsf272,"When I was in the navy my roommate got an email from ""the united state Americans federal FBI"" accusing him of having bad things on his computers.  He had to pay 5,000 in Walmart gift cards.  Or the CIA was going to come and arrest him and put him in jail for 52 years.

Dude tripped balls he found a way to get the money.   He sold his car for a chunk of it.

I thought his reaction was suspicious af.  While he was scrambling for money I started digging on his computer.... Anyway the base police were there to arrest him when he got back"
lxsn27g,Plot twist: The roommate faked the scam and got a lot of free money from friends 😆
lxtdcj6,Your friend was most likely doing something they shouldn't have been doing.  People don't fall this hard for this type of scam without believing it's true.  It can only be believed to be true if the target was doing something wrong in the first place.  The other reason is they are just stupid as hell.
lxvpnbh,Definitely not my friend lol 
lxvx9c5,"They're doing something wrong or they're stupid.  One of two choices, it can't be neither.  No smart person would fall for it and someone doing something questionable legally it might scare them."

lxwiso1,Why you stick up for this dude you don't know like I insulted your mother or some shit?
ly4m0i0,"??? I did not stand up for this person whatsoever. Maybe you need your eyes checked. They’re not my friend, that’s all I said. I just kinda knew this person once-upon-a-time. Don’t even remember their name. "
lxtne2e,"I got scammed out of $21,000 and my parents bailed me out. So like, some people are able to afford it. I was a dumb kid and fell for an employment scam"
lxvpm28,"It’s one thing for parents to bail you out and a totally different thing for them to give you money to give to a scammer though…. I had a colleague who was scammed out of $3k+ through an employment scam where a “researcher” sent out a recruiting email asking for someone to do work for their study which included buying gift cards for participants and being reimbursed later on + wages. She should’ve known better but sometimes those scams can look pretty convincing so I understand how she got past step #1, it’s just a little tougher with step #2 which is spending thousands of your own money. Someone bailed her out, she learned a tough lesson, and now she’s working a real job. If she had asked any of us or her parents or an advisor, we would have all spotted the red flag and none of us would have given her money that would have gone to the scammers (I think, anyway). "
lxw04l4,"No it wasn’t like that, they didn’t know it was a scammer either but I was using my own money. But I would’ve been $15k in the hole if they didn’t give me the $15k after. It was tough bc the scammer was using the name of a guy who my mom knew actually did work at this rehab place so the guy I was working for was someone I knew. Except it actually wasn’t. It was dumb. But trust me, I’m an expert on scams now"

lxpmueu,I work in retail- it’s shocking to me how many people get genuinely angry that you think they’re being scammed. I’ve been screamed and berated as people insist they know what they’re doing only to find out they were wrong. I refused one lady because she was buying cards to purchase a dog- I asked certain questions and decided I wasn’t making the sale as she was definitely being scammed. She called me a dumb bitch and said she wanted me fired when she came back in with her dog. Never did get to see that puppy!

lxpyry0,I really can't fathom someone requesting payment for anything with a gift card. Gift cards are a fucking hassle and I have a bout a dozen that I have never even used.

I hate getting one that tells me ""hey now you need to go to this place you probably weren't planning on"", when I just gave them a thing they might use in their house."
lxqdk11,"Yeah, gift cards should just be banned. I've always found it super weird that some people actually give them as gifts. If I ever got one, I'd tell the gift giver to just not give me a gift next time, or give the amount in cash if they really insist."

why are they desperate to get jobs when the employment rate is doing so well?"
lxucm7u,"just not enough jobs. Everyone who wants a job can find one?… but. that means there are not enough jobs to  go around for everyone person who wants one?  Currently, people who can’t find any other way to make money are falling for those gift card scams (from the OP) 

At least. That’s how I understood it!! I think this is just clunky wording on my part ^ but I’m adhd and I’m confusing myself "
lxueonw,"Sounds more like high *un*employment.

High employment is more jobs to go around relative to people looking (so it's easier for everyone to find one)."
lxrax93,"My local convenience store has signs up by their gift card displays saying ""Consumer Alert: no law enforcement, including the IRS or FBI, accepts payment in gift cards. If you've been asked to buy gift cards to pay a tax bill or judgement, call the below number for help."" and the number is a local consumer-protection group."
lxvaoq3,"That is awesome, more stores should have that."
lxp6uil,Is there ever a different reason?
lxq74ag,"I had to hammer it into my parent's heads about these scams, so they never fall for it. Now my parents just mess with the scammers when they call them. lol


The ones that pretend to be lawyers or attorneys are worrying though."
lxqlliy,"That's fraught with risk, including possible revenge. More one interacts with scammers, more chance of being scammed. Talk with your parents and emphasize they should screen their calls (not answering is best; landlines tend to be worse) or hangup immediately. Not worth messing with scammers.

No one knows every scam nor variation. Everyone is susceptible to be scammed given the right conditions. In a rush, coincidence, etc.

Also, many rely on various 3rd parties when determining whether an interaction is real or not. Sometimes that trust can be misplaced. Friend's emails, social media, phone, etc compromised (very common) allowing a fraudster to gather information and even interject.

Happens a lot with real estate closings. Buyer is told to wire funds to the settlement company, but unknown to either party involved, someone is eavesdropping. Then interjects at the opportune time with bogus wire instructions. Could be an email or even a phone call. Yes, this is a known scam, but most still unaware. And some variations (ie. voice spoofing) will appear so legit that most buyers would never question it.

Sure, others can come up with better examples. Rambling on, but this is something I had to explain to a relative. Didn't even realize how close they'd come to be scammed. They were lucky. Not all are."

Apparently it was one of these. She rushed to get around $5000 worth of gift cards. They got it all. 

The kicker is my wife works in a joint business that does financial advising, insurance and accounting. If she would have brought it up to anyone (her boss being a CPA and extremely knowledgeable on tax law) they could have told her it immediately was a scam. The IRS does not call people. They send letters. And no way in hell is any government body accepting gift cards?? 

I felt bad for her because there was no way in getting the money back but she had help so close but panicked and left instead."

Thankfully, her son was a co-signer on the account. So, the teller excused herself and discreetly called the son to let him know what was going on. He told the teller to stall, he and his son got in their car and went straight to the bank to stop it and show her her grandson was fine! $20K loss averted and the son said if she EVER got a call like that again to hang up immediately and call him. He'd handle whatever was going on (which in 99% of cases would be absolutely nothing).

Thankfully the teller was caring and astute."
lxrbrux,"> If she would have brought it up to anyone (her boss being a CPA and extremely knowledgeable on tax law) they could have told her it immediately was a scam. 

But that might be _embarassing_. Scammers rely very heavily on fear as a motivator for action and shame as a motivator for keeping the conversation private.

It's why these things are almost always some variant of ""you've been a very bad person and everyone will know if you don't act quickly"" -- from IRS scams to sextortion. And it's also why it works even with stuff entirely _made up_. I got contacted by a scammer who sent me info from my public LinkedIn profile and said they'd contact all my colleagues and tell them I was having an affair and that they ""had very convincing evidence"".

This works on people because they're so afraid that _even though it's not true_, they'll be shamed and embarrassed. And that means they're unlikely to seek help to solve the problem. (In my case, I'm polyam and don't need to keep that a secret, so it was just funny; but I can definitely understand why a lot of people would be freaked out enough that their judgement would be impaired long enough for the scam to work)."

lxr4mit,"While I don't think falling for a scam is grounds on its own to be fired, I can tell you that to work for an investment broker, the broker is legally required to investigate your debts and any kind of hole you might legally be in when they hire you. You have to fill out a questionnaire every year disclosing if you have any outside business, if you've arranged for a alternate form of loan repayment etc."
lxrrd9h,"Yeah, but I'm guessing this person wasn't actually advising anyone.  She was probably just some office drone.  Possibly should have been fired anyway, but it's one thing to grudgingly do it because it's necessary and another thing to be hungry for someone who's already been scammed to have her livelihood stripped away just because she was a little naive."

lxpq7sa,"I remember someone pointing out once that the IRS *did* call them first, but then they also noted that it was a business account, not an individual one.

There needs to be written records, which a phone call doesn't provide. They will send a letter, you will send a letter or form back at some point, whatever. At some point, a conversation will happen, but there will also be a record. What's the proof of what you owed? What's the proof that your Target gift cards went through and were applied? There isn't any. Anyone demanding money from you should be able to provide written proof--debt buyers can't provide it, and IRS scammers can't provide it.

Another group that doesn't call first is the police, or FBI, not *when they're going to arrest you*. Like, ""send us these gift cards right now or we'll send the police to your house."" Nope, not a thing. If there's a valid reason for the cops/FBI to come arrest you, they'll just do that. It tends not to work in their favor to warn criminals of their plans ahead of time, weirdly."
lxr4g4x,"Plus, they are always willing to negotiate. They know that if their systems show you owe $25k in taxes, there’s a damn good chance you screwed up filing your return. 

They’ll invite you to come in and work through your return and look over your records and all the rest. Your debt just might vanish once you correct the errors. Or the IRS will settle for pennies on the dollar. 

IRS is one of the easier federal agencies to work with. Just don’t come in screaming about the injustice of paying taxes. Or that you’re a sovereign citizen or some other variety of kook. Talk like that and IRS will break you into a 1000 pieces and scatter you in the wind."
lxqmiw0,"yep, US First Class Priority Mail"
lxpclob,"At least getting you to make a debit card over the phones *makes sense* in the context of paying a tax debt.

Even just thinking about it for a second, ***why*** would the IRS want Apple iTunes cards???"
lxrcuvt,"That's at least more believable than most of these scams. ""Pay via debit card"" is a much more believable option than ""go buy gift cards and give us the numbers"", and as you said, the call fit your circumstances which was lucky for the scammer.

The big red flag I wish we'd hammer home for more people is that ""created urgency"". There is _never_ a legitimate thing so urgent that someone who calls you needs payment _while you're on the phone_ in order to avoid some dire consequence. No matter who supposedly needs money, you should be able to say ""ok, let me get a reference number from you and I'll call back"", and then call a number you get from a trusted online source (like irs.gov for the IRS) without any issue.

Even fucking _bill collectors_ will happily give you their license number, company name and address, etc. and are required to send you proof of the debt in the mail."
lxptvpx,"Also, it's good to remember that there's almost never a situation like this that can't wait. If there's even a single thing that raises the slightest alarm, just ask for the contact information and say you'll get back with them tomorrow or something. Then go check it out, ask for help, etc, and you'll see that it's almost certainly a scam. If it was actually legitimate, it can wait. 

This also works for things that aren't actually scams but are just bad deals. Like if you're thinking of buying something but you think it might be overpriced. Oh, it might not be a *scam*, you might actually be getting what's promised. But if you're being encouraged to buy now because it's gonna be gone by the time you get back, good chance that it's *at least* just a really bad deal. 

When someone says **ACT NOW**, that is often a huge red flag. Obviously doesn't always apply to stuff like disaster scenarios, but when it comes to dealings with governments and businesses this stuff can almost always wait. If they're saying that you can't wait, then it's probably bullshit and they're just utilizing fear (whether that be fear of penalties or fear of missing out) to override peoples' critical thinking abilities."
lxpe2r2,"That's the thing.  They catch you off balance when you're not expecting it, and are often good at keeping you off balance and not giving time to think.

Doesn't work every time, but you catch someone offguard in the wrong mindset, and it can easily loop into ""admitting I'm falling for it would be worse than continuing onward"" mental state.

Good thought on texting a 3rd party to get another brain involved."

lxp7z2q,"When I was 18, I got a call from the “IRS”, informing me that they were sending an officer to my home address immediately due to tax evasion. They insisted I had evaded over $8,000 in taxes over the last two years.

Somehow I thought, as a sleepy (having just woken up) 18 year old kid, that I had accidentally not paid taxes on my summer job that made me a very, *very* tiny fraction of that total.

I panicked and was on the verge of a complete meltdown, just as he demanded some of my more sensitive information to keep the officers from coming to the house. I thought, “if they were coming to arrest me, wouldn’t they not care if I paid money? If I commit a crime, I can’t just pay it away, that makes no sense.”

(Not to mention I had very little money to my name as it was, lol.) 

Anyway, I emailed my mom and stalled the guy on the phone, just long enough for her to reply with “THE IRS NEVER CALLS YOU!!!!!”

I told him I had figured him out and asked him why on earth he would do this to innocent people — he told me to go fuck myself and hung up on me. Lmfao"

Yeah, the multi million pound earning data carrier is going to just be offering customers huge discounts for no reason. Right. Also, I'm out of contract and on a sim-only plan. The woman spent a long time trying to convince me that they really were that company and really were offering the discount to 'long term customers for their loyalty.' She got very upset with me when I informed her I actually used to work for that company in question and knew exactly where all the legit call centres were located and that billing dials out on one number only. Asked a bunch of jargon filled questions about GDPR and the ICO and long distance selling rights and she just hung up.

lxq1koj,"Ages ago I read an article about a man who got scammed. He got a call saying that he won a contest. He hadn't taken part in one, but his wife regularly does and uses both their names, so he didn't think anything of it and thought it was legit.

They said he had the choice between a brand new Mercedes or 70,000€. He chose the money, and they said that to oversee the transfer they needed to hire a notary which costs like 500€ and that he'd have to pay up front (which he didn't mind since he'd get 70,000€ later), but the notary they always hire for this doesn't trust the banking system, so he only accepts payment in form of Steam gift cards.

So this guy went to a local store, bought a 500€ Steam gift card, called back the number they gave him, told them the code, they said they'd verify it and call him back later, and he never heard from them again."

lxps10k,Nah MLMers make their money by recruiting others. Not selling product.
lxrycd8,"Exactly. I had a friend growing up who was pretty well off by the standards of my area. Always had the latest gaming system, a dirt bike, and went snowboarding all the time during winter.  His mom was in an MLM but mostly recruited people into it and sold large quantities to them rather than selling to actual customers.  

My parents hated her. Any time I hung out with that guy, they'd have me walk to a nearby park and pick me up from there just to avoid having her try to recruit them."
lxsj3l6,"Yep. All the people they recruit, and the ones those recruit and so on are called a ""downline"" and they get kickbacks from every single person's product purchased. So if you recruit 5 people, and they all recruit 5 people, and everyone makes $1000 with you getting a 20% cut, they made $800 and you made $4k. And actually they may have lost money due to paying for stock and fees. Those people go on to each recruit 5 more and then you tack on 125 people to your downline. Same numbers and you make $29,000. But the people at the bottom of the downline (not pyramid cuz people get offended when you call it that) actually selling product are still only making $800 or losing money. Another level of 5 each and you pull 156k. 

You can see why it's considered a pyramid scheme and very few actually make money. You have to get in on someone's downline to be able to sell product. There's no way for everyone to be able to make decent money. There literally has to be people making nothing or even ending up net negative for others to have a downline and profit."
lxpq6th,"cutco/vector marketing is not an MLM.  don't get me wrong, i'm not saying they're a legit reputable company.  it's just that their specific scammyness is not the MLM model.  it's a rather unique system of basically recruiting en masse proxy sales people.  if they went around to 300 houses in a neighborhood trying to sell knives to strangers it would take a week and they'd maybe sell 4 sets, but if they hold a seminar and recruit people's kids to have their parents and friends buy, they hit those same 300 houses with only 4 hours of work and a 40% success rate.  they don't do the downline thing or make you fill your garage with product.  instead they set unattainable goals, and make you quit on your own after you sold to your first and second level contacts.  i mean they can't do the garage filling because their product isn't prettied up garbage the way that herbalife or lularoe stuff is, it's actually quality durable goods they can't afford to saturate the market with."
lxry0z0,"Do you remember that scene from The Office where Michael is trying to explain how he's not part of a pyramid scheme, he just needs to recruit a couple of people to sell the product, then they recruit more people, and everyone gets a cut? That's the EXACT sales plan for Cutco. They're whole thing is, ""You start off selling, and then you get people to sell for you, and they get people to sell for them, and you climb out corporate ladder until you can stop selling because everyone you recruited makes the money for you."""
lxs1svd,"no, vector marketing does not do that.  but again let me reiterate, this is not defending them.  i'm just explaining that the way their scam works is a different scam than an MLM, it's still a scam."
lxp1q8n,Cutco! It’s a scam to sell but damn those are good knives.
lxp4yj1,"One of my best friends back in the day got into Cutco and I bought a couple of the knives because I knew she was in an awful situation at the time. I'm shocked they don't have a better business model because they REALLY are good knives.


ETA: People have really strong opinions about these knives, apparently"
lxpnmxi,"Blows my mind that quality products get into MLM stuff or stay in that space after being established, you'd think they'd have better brand loyalty by putting them in stores / online. Tupperware is a good case study for switching from 'direct marketing' to more legitimate business practice."
lxqhutm,"Avon makeup as well. I also really enjoyed a lot of pampered chef things as a kid. Nowadays it's easy to find all these specialty kitchen tools online and have it shipped to your door, but back in the 90s, the pampered chef introduced my family to a lot of neat products you couldnt find in stores. We still have some of them!"
lxqt5p1,Tupperware filed for bankruptcy a few months ago…
lxrwz2p,"Cheap ceramics from Walmart and Target and cheap plastics from Rubbermaid are their competition, and on top of all that, other MLMs gave their sales model a bad name."
lxqujhb,Tupperware is bankrupt lol
lxrmxxr,"Cutco has sorta gotten a little into that side of things, at least. I see them running a stand at Costco a couple times a year."
lxs4jci,"Tupperware just filed bankruptcy and the local distributor is sending out scam orders, funny enough."
lxqdbl9,People still do the odd Tupperware Party here in Australia. I went to one around eight years ago.
lxpr6vt,I saw Cutco at my Costco. Now that's where you should be selling $1000 knives.
lxpavvo,"They are good, the neighbor kid was selling them (they get commission or something) and the scissors cut a penny in half. I thought it was cool but only ever cut paper so I passed on that."
lxrxecm,"Hah ha. You do know that cutting paper is one of the most dulling things you can do with scissors, right?

(Yes, I can still do the penny trick.)"
lxpdqqa,"My wife and i bought ourselves a 21 piece set for our wedding, absolutely zero regrets. 

10 years later they still perform great, i touch them up every 6 months or so."
lxpk5wr,"The last time I bought a knife set was 21 years ago and they cost me the equivalent of around $30 tiday. They're still working great. Hopefully you paid about the same price otherwise you're the prime example why these scams still exist:


Because people are dumb and advertise their stupidity, which gets other dumb people to do the same ..."
lxp8xmm,Nice try paid cutco shill...
lxpby4a,They’re actually really good hahaha.
lxpe81g,"Almost lost my thumb cutting a cabbage In half

Not a shill"
lxrxurw,"You cut toward yourself? For shame!

But seriously, a Cutco demonstration and the warnings which come with it is probably the only knife safety instruction most people ever get nowadays. Unless they were in Scouts or an equivalent youth militia."
lxpcojv,Yep I have four steak knives and finally after 30 years they need to be sharpened.
lxpcydn,My mother sent some back a few years ago to be sharpened. They also replaced a few of the handles for no charge and without asking. They just treated it as a part of the maintenance of sharpening.
lxpd1ya,"My pops bought the deer gutting knife and it flew through bone so easily. I bought the steak knife, paring knife, and the carver as well as the scissors. Fucking phenomenal, also they will re sharpen for free."
lxpoz69,"I was pitched Cutco once, and the guy cut a penny with the poultry shears."
lxpqxcz,"The overpriced kitchen good store near me sharpens for 75c an inch and 48 hour turnaround (I.e probably places that do it cheaper, faster, and better). I know I won't be sending knives somewhere to be sharpened - probably a 4-6 week turnaround. All that to say, free sharpening isn't really a great benefit, let alone one to make you go Cutco over another likely better, cheaper brand."
lxr47bb,The meat department at my local grocery store will sharpen three knives per visit for free.  I brought in a machete as a joke once.  They sharpened it to the point that I shouldn't have been allowed to walk through the store with it afterward.
lxs8mlu,"Well shoot, I wonder if any do that around me..."
lxpix7h,My dad still has the ones he bought in the 70s.
lxph22e,"No they're absolutely not, they're cheap steel and serrated so they stay sharper a little longer, but you'd be way better off buying a Victorinox set and a sharpening stone for less than half the price."
lxph76i,I’ll check them out.
lxqkukq,They are not. You just never tried good knives.
lxqs0re,Definitely down for recommendations if you have them!
lxrkvs0,Victorinox.  Their kitchen stuff is tremendous for the price.
lxqunj0,"In the budget range nothing beats Dao Vau knives. I have a collection of around 30 knives ranging from 5 dollar to 1,500 dollar and was blown away with their performance.  They are so good I imported 50 of them for gift and to sell to friends and family. Then one of my friends were so blown away that we imported a 150 more together and sold them all in 2 weeks during Christmas(I dont recommend selling so many knives in such a short time with no retail experience). They are not rustresistant so they require some care like not leaving them wet, but after they get patina they are quite resistant."
lxrerfe,This is just Cutco with extra steps lol.
lxrlfxs,If you think they are the same as Cutco you simply dont know knives.
lxu19c3,"I'm saying what you are doing is.


Youre saying cutco are objectively terrible knives in a thread about MLM being bad while essentially doing what they do:


Buy a fuck ton of knives and sell to family, then get your friends to do it with you, too. 


The difference, in your mind, is your knives aren't shit."
lxu3yzv,"I didnt make any money off it, never intended to make any money. I bought them because I wanted my friends share my enthusiasm in these knives as they are amazing and will change how you view prepwork.

I only helped my friend make some money as he wanted to do it and it was fun doing it together. My daily job as a lawyer makes it completely irrational to ever try to make money of selling stuff as I make a month profit selling knives in a few days at my office.

I know the owner of the most successful knife shop in my country pretty well. i make 3 times his salary. if I ever sold knives to make money I would be stupid"
lxqyxf6,"I used to be a commercial chef, we paid a guy to come and sharpen our $300 kitchen knives every other week (he would actually just swap them out and then sharpen the ones we had) and then just rotate. So we always had really good knives.

I was still impressed with Cutco's quality. I don't know why they just don't sell them in stores, their business model is so archaic."
lxpyppn,the knife business is very cutthroat
lxpd675,"Their scissors are absolutely elite. 

They can cut a penny!"
lxr3zpj,Great kitchen shears!  Cut a chicken in half or use it to cup a toddler's food right in the bowl.
lxptw5r,"Similarly, one of my classmates decided to start her own 'branch' where they were the boss and recruited a whole bunch of underlings. She basically hire anyone who replied to her job posting and spent time training them bc I believe she pockets the upfront fee.

Long story short it lasted a couple of months and she stopped doing Vector."
lxqj1rn,"My university boyfriend sold those, and the were good knives! My parents bought a couple, but that was decades ago and I have no idea whatever happened to them. The knives, that is - I know where my parents are."
lxpovs5,"lol.  how is that not a great business model?  would you have bought the knives from the person who recruited her?  no, but you did buy them from their proxy (your friend).  it's genius!"
lxpx8y9,Yeah buddy gave me a filet knife from them for my birthday in like 05. It's cleaned every fish I've caught since then.
lxqb3aq,"Tbh the one piece of theirs I actually do love and will fight for is that damn can opener.  It’s super comfy to hold, the crank is nice and fat which makes it easy to turn, and the magnet in the tip is a godsend for opening cans of sticky shit I don’t wanna risk touching.   

Seriously can that company please just sign a deal with Williams Sonoma or something so we can buy the decent pieces in a store"
lxrwacw,"Everyone would either buy the cheapest Chinese knives in Target or the most expensive German knives at the mall, back in the 00’s. Now they just Sort By Price or Sort By Featured on Amazon.

Cutco is none of these, so they’re finding their market niche in the most efficient way: having college dropouts with no social skills bug their moms’ friends."
lxqksyz,You should really try actually good knives. Cutco knives are 5 dollar knives and terrible on all factors.
lxrnmct,"Glad to see someone with sense here lmao. They are garbage. It's insane how many Redditors, even just in this comment thread have fell for their bs."
lxpfggg,the amount of pressure I've seen their salespeople apply during a sale is intense.  I had to block the phone number of the salesperson stalking me.
lxr0ujy,"same with Kirby vacuums.  

back before we got these super light, cordless, collapsible things they were the tips for an all-in-one unit.  heavy as fuck but could do everything you wanted, even curtains.

can't buy one in a store even though it is the best of its class."
lxrtczi,It works!
lxukz6f,"I didn't realize cutco was an mlm, I bought mine at a pop-up in Costco. It makes sense though. I had seen the booth a few different times before I bought any, and the sales person always had this old cutco knife that their grandma bought in the 70s, and it still cut so well. Its crazy that three different salespeople all had grandmas that bought the exact same knife and passed it down to them /s"
lxp4zpp,"Same. I got suckered into trying to sell those around 2002/2003...and I still have my set, use them daily. The knives are awesome. How they sell them, is what's a scam."
lxpa5wm,how do they sell them? o:
lxpbbul,"They have you buy your demo set from them for a reduced price. The demo set is not their full set, but the essential pieces. And they tell you that when you stop selling Cutco, you can either 1) keep them fpr personal use, or 2) can sell them, but not for less than you bought them for. 

Then, to sell...they have you set up a ""no strings"" expected sales pitches to friends and family. And after you have demoed the knives to these friends and family...perhaps sold them some...you ask the friends and family for people they know that you can set up more demos for. And then you aak those people for more people you can do a demo for. And keep asking..."
lxpblo2,Lmao that is annoying as hell.
lxpbvk9,"I felt it just made it awkward for everyone involved. Most didn't want to give leads, some felt guilted into it. But doing it this way, Cutco could promise you there were no ""cold calls"" in selling your knives."
lxrg9sj,"I had just moved back home from college and was looking for a job, answered one of those ""$14 an hour!"" sheets that were all over telephone poles back then.  Got hired in and they didn't even tell us what it was for until the first day of training.  When they got to the point where they told us we had to buy the demo set before we could start selling I literally laughed out loud, got up and walked out.  Pre internet days were crazy."
lxrqm00,"Just curious how this is different than tupperware parties, which has generally been viewed as a legitimate business (hasn't it?)

(Yes, I'm aware they have finally succumbed to the market, but they were successful for decades)."
lxrqn81,I was able to return my demo set no problem.
lxpf3nx,"They get teens to go around and give presentations pushing them on people, advertising a deceptively high hourly pay (that they aren't likely to get unless they sell very effectively and doesn't include some things like the fact that the kids have to buy their own demo set). The sales technique kinds of relies on people guilt-buying knives to help out their friends' kids."
lxpbq6l,"Essentially, they target people in relatively unstable financial situations and pull some tricks that tries to make them pay for the knives if they are unable to sell."
lxqkwbo,"They are not awesome, you just never tried using a good knife."
lxrfcpw,"I have a ton of good knives. Cutco stands the test of time, and quality service (life time guarantee). I'd like to know why you think they are not good. 

Also made in America if you care about that at all."
lxrnj78,"What good knives do you have? Global and crap like that?

They are not good because they have a absolutely joke of a grind. Just a machined hollow grind with terrible thickness behind the edge making them cleavers instead of kitchen knives. 

Next the metal is below average and terrible for the price they charge. It is worse than a freaking IKEA knife. Also at 56-59 they are not very hard and will dull fast.

The price for their knives are just INSANE as you can get very good japanese knives with high end steel, handmade and proper grind for the same price as those super marked quality knives. Only someone with no knowledge of knives would ever think they are worth their price. Maybe if you can get one for 10 dollar at flea marked.  

  
\> Also made in America if you care about that at all.

So you confirm it is crap?"
lxrovk5,"Just a heads up, try being less snarky and condescending and people might want to have conversations on the topic. People would be more open to discussing the topic as opposed to arguing with a random over the internet."
lxrrdvo,You are right. Just annoys me that people with no knowledge about a subject gives bad advice on it. like a guy giving car advice  having only driven a 1988 Trabant thinking they are good cars
lxpb1mg,Elaborate please. I'm genuinely curious
lxqpkid,"I never got as far as selling and ended up turning in my sales kit for a refund and quitting (mostly I refused to use friends/family for my first calls and they got very frustrated with me so I changed my mind), but for a brief time I did have the knife set in my car.  During this time I got locked out of my house and ended up using one of the knives to pry open a window and climb into my house.  It worked really well for that."
lxucy60,"Same. My favorite knife is a small serrated knife and it’s amazing. My family had a whole set we bought from a family friend and those were the special good knives. There was a spatula one with a serrated edge and a smooth edge that my dad treated like another child, it was so precious to him."
lxp4qk2,I find them at thrift stores and have a whole set. Love them!
lxpdz0v,And you can get them resharpened for free still!
lxtbemi,and you can send them back to get sharpened for free!
lxp8gxp,"I feel the same about pampered chef/tupperware. Hate the fucking business model, but they truly are great products with amazing warranties."
lxp9d4e,"Yes!! My god, do I love Tupperware products"
lxp8ufm,Oh hell yeah!!
lxp95yu,"Back in the late 90's right after gradating high school I got an interview at some office for some job. No details on the job or requirements. It ended up being a Cutco marketing recruiting thing.

I've never taken another interview invite by mail again."
lxp7qx7,My mom felt bad for a kid who was selling those like 30 years ago and bought a few.  She still uses them.
lxpbxkg,Didn't OJ have a complete set?
lxpeyg7,"I went to the Cutco factory in Olean, NY to buy a set -- they're that good. 

But the sales & marketing schtick they used to do.... Yeah, that was scammy."
lxp320v,literally so good lol
lxpc6tp,"I’ve heard of cutco, but I’ve never really been exposed to it. What’s the scam, or is it just an MLM?"
lxrpkak,"The whole business model is advertising a “No experience necessary” sales job, selling a demonstration set to your employee, maybe they sell a set or two to some relatives before quitting, repeat with new employee.

They’ve been doing the same thing for more than 50 years! (My dad sold a few sets post college)"
lxpd6qn,It’s an MLM where you sell knives. Seriously.
lxpefmm,"Yea, that’s kinda what I figured. MLMs in general are such giant scams."
lxrnr09,"An MLM, and they're shitty knives."
lxpkmzz,"Dumb college kids who are too lazy to get a real summer job get sold on it. They spend the summer trying to sell knife sets to their friends & family. They’re average quality and overpriced.

People often buy them out of guilt because the kid selling them is an idiot."
lxpk41l,"I mean, they’re ok quality. You could get wostofs for cheaper"
lxrntpn,"Wusthofs are SO much better it's not even close.

Cutco are not great knives at all."
lxpjld0,"It’s not even a scam to sell. They’re just predatory as fuck. 

Scam would imply the knives suck, which they absolutely do not."
lxp4tac,My dad bought a set almost 20 years years only because one of his friend's son was selling and my dad would buy if he found absolutely other job
lxp5plq,Agreed
lxp7wdx,Had mine since 2004.
lxpbecn,"My son got recruited to sell those, and we bought some. They are amazing, but he quickly realized their business practices amounted to a pyramid scheme- and it wasn’t the kids selling that made money."
lxpdoi6,They are! I own a few.
lxpkpmb,"They're lower-mid tier knives at high tier prices       
My parents got me a set for my wedding, and I upgraded to Wusthof and the experience is night and day"
lxplwhi,">but damn those are good knives.

They're *ok*, not good, and terribly terribly overpriced for the quality. The steel is basically ""the minimum acceptable quality"" for a kitchen knife and for the amount they charge, I'd rather have a stamped knife with better steel at 1/5th of the price with a more comfortable handle."
lxq4veu,"Yep!  

It's not an MLM, because you get paid on what you sell, and usually don't get a piece of who you recruit. 

But it is a shitty sales job.  

The real irony?  Is that I recall they still pay a minimum wage for appointments, which is much better than commission only sales jobs.  It's actually 'far from the worst'."
lxqh85g,Okay but I had a friend that worked there that gave me a knife as a gift… BEST knife I have maybe there’s something to it…😂😂
lxqkqv5,If you compare them to a piece of soft plywood they could be considered good. They are not good they are so incredibly bad.
lxqmsrb,I sold my mom a set of Cutco knives over 30+ years ago and they are as good today as they were then.
lxr6cpg,"My brother got sucked into that program. He sold to his family and then his friends. After that, there was no one else to sell to and then he quit. The knives are rather good, however."
lxra6qd,I still have the $1000+ set I won while selling them and they are so good 😂 would never buy again but man they are good
lxrf7rn,My parents listened to a kid in our church selling cutco more out of being politeness and to give him practice...then he pulled out the scissors and cut a penny in front of them and they bought a set from him because they wanted those scissors
lxrhpjo,"Same with Kirby! The door to door sales is nonsense, but the vacuums are ah-mazing."
lxrjkrm,"They may be good, but they are insanely overpriced. There are plenty of brands that are cheaper and just as good if not better."
lxs4cyg,Still the best knive I've ever used. Even though it was like $100
lxp5beu,They are only good knives for people who don't know how to keep real knives sharp.
lxp5kp6,Ok ok I’ll get off your lawn
lxtiuds,"I won't convince the masses here, but I'll make my pitch anyway. 

Looking at basically all objective measures of performance at the price that cutco sells knives, they are inferior to similarly priced traditional knives.

Stamped blades     
Worse edge retention     
Less balanced     
Harder to sharpen at home     
Inferior metal     
Worse comfort in the hand     

Subjectively they also lose in the method of high pressure sales.    

The one area they perform objectively better than similarly priced knives is their warranty. If you're using them to cut into your tuna cans (like they demonstrate in the sales pitch) you'll definitely need that warranty at some point. If you use them like knives instead of can openers, screw drivers, or pry bars, it is unlikely you will ever use the warranty. 

Generally speaking, most knife sets are a tremendous waste of money. You're much better off buying a chef's knife, a boning/fillet style knife, a paring knife, and 4 steak knives, than you are filling out a block with knives you never touch. If you don't know how to sharpen knives, find someone local who does it. Won't cost much more than what cutco charges to send knives back and forth."
lxpbcjt,Umm… we get our Cutco knives sharpened for free
lxpgjoq,"My mom scours garage sales for any cutco now if she can find. She's found quite a few. Once she found an old set of wood handled steak knives that were falling apart. She went in to get sharpened, and they sent her brand new ones with nice poly handles. Free of course."
lxphisn,"Best knives ever! I have the butcher block set with 5 knives, scissors and steak knives that I bought from my nephew when he was in college 15 years ago. Then about 4 years ago my daughter asked for knives for Christmas, and they just happened to have a Costco booth, so I bought her a butcher block set for Christmas, a set of steak knives that I gave her for her birthday, and a set of three chopping knives for me. Use these knives daily, even take them on vacation because I hate not having good knives. I've been accused of being a knife snob lol"
lxpjipt,They have damn good knives so I don’t need to buy any more! Stop calling and sending me mail Micheal!!!!
lxpbzi5,"I have a set. I also have really good knives.

Cutco steak knives are decent. Serrated knives are okay. Chef knife is shit and doesn’t hold an edge. Bread knife has a great shape and length -I wish it were better…"
lxpil24,Sometimes they have a guy demonstrating and selling them at Costco
lxpq2c5,"Hell, they're selling them at Costco! :o"
lxq56l7,Don't they sell at Costco?
lxqncvv,"I mean, they’re okay as far as knives go. It’s not actually that hard to make serviceable knife -  there’s a youtube video of a guy making a sharp kitchen knife out of noodles or something - it’s hard to make something affordable that retains its edge well for a long time. Cutco knives dull relatively quickly and are overpriced for what you get. Global, Zwilling, and Victorinox all make better knives for the same or lower prices."
lxsthww,"Right? I wish you could just buy them at a STORE like a fucking normal business. I don't wanna go looking for some random college kid to buy a knife off of. I don't understand how that business model even works. I actually worked for cutco, never had to pay them a dime for anything, but made about $100 doing those silly presentations for my friend's parents who I knew would never buy one but would give me 45 minutes of their time."
lxu8xlo,"They really are.  My mom bought a set 30-ish years ago, and still has em."
lxvoya2,That's what I was gonna say
lxp51e4,"Cutco, yes. They are one of the only pyramid schemes with an actually quality product though. The knives are incredibly durable, and they have what is essentially a lifetime warranty. My parents bought some from one of their friends kid, they’ve had them for like 20 years now."
lxpctgf,"Honestly a bit of a shame when a quality product is wrapped up in being a pyramid scheme. I feel the same way about Advocare, which have an awful rap for their sales practice and a lot of their ""weight loss"" products, but they also make one of the only healthy energy drink alternatives I actually like drinking."
lxpg2my,"I replied to another person my story of my mom buying a Cutco slotted spoon in the 90's from my babysitter's boyfriend. She still has it to this day. And my older lady neighbor has friends who sell Amway products and she ""signed up"" but just buys stuff for herself since a decent amount of the personal care products are good and good to give as gifts.

If you know you're not going to make a career, or even beer money, off of it, all MLM products aren't bad even if their business practices are deplorable."
lxph1yn,"Is it really a pyramid scheme? From what I understand you don't recruit other sellers as your ""downstream"" or whatever, there aren't layers of people above getting a piece of your sales, and you don't have to buy the product yourself. Seems like they are a direct sales company with an overpriced product and predatory tactics to recruit sales people that will be severely underpaid. Absolute scum bags, yes. Different type of scum than what I'd call a pyramid schemes though."
lxpilwr,"I work for CUTCO and you do recruit people. I got in from my friend and in the interview you basically give them three more people to interview. It’s also always automatic hire. I only got more money for sales but obviously the rest of the money was going somewhere. 
It is true you don’t have to buy your stuff. You can though. I wish I had the money too."
lxpjoaw,"Do you get anything from the people you recruit though? That's what the downstream bullshit is that makes something a pyramid scheme. You get a cut of your recruits sales, and a cut of sales from who they recruit and so on."
lxrgf70,That depends if you are running a local office or not. They have other divisions that are not what they call door to door sales.
lxrg365,"I dated someone in Cutco for a long time. Everyone is talking about the local offices as opposed to their other divisions. She mainly worked for the events team, so she would go to conventions, markets, etc. The girl made really good money (about 85k/year) and did absolutely no recruiting or downstream BS. However, she did have a boss in the area that basically did fuck all and just made a percentage from her which was a bit dumb. They also got to go on full-paid vacations maybe 5 times a year. Received tons of gifts (Rolex, gold ruby encrusted ring). 

The only thing I had a problem with was it essentially became a cult in that area of the company. All of her friends and people she would hang out with was nothing but Cutco or Vector marketing people."
lxqyvkn,"Back in the day the MLMs like many other consumer products used to have quality, Cutco, Avon, Mary Kay.  Newer ones just sell junk."
lxr2r7m,"Tupperware too I guess, although they got out of the MLM game a while ago"
lxr9q0m,"Pampered Chef stuff is decent as well.  I have a few pieces I've bought through garage sales and eBay, very happy with the quality."
lxp9m9z,"Cutco? I don't know about what's involved in selling them, but they're great knives.  Still using the one I got in 1976."
lxqzfcn,"When you start ""working"" for them, not only do you have to attend motivation meetings for 2 days without them paying you but you also have to front the money for the demonstration set you will be using to try and convince your family and friends to buy that shit. They might be good knives but they operate like scammers."
lxp5dm9,They were trying to convince college kids they could make $15/hr in 2005 lol.
lxpfdv1,I just think of Frank Reynolds selling knives
lxr1jo6,Pretend this shoe is an unboned chicken
lxp7iwf,CUTCO!! They tried to recruit me when I was young and dumb. Thank god for my friend Joe!!
lxp8cqm,"Lol I worked for them!

I actually did fairly well.  Technically not a scam but they’re overpriced and a large portion of the cost of the knives goes to the salesperson."
lxqprke,"I'm embarrassed to say I tried to sell knives when I was 19. Utter failure.

The good thing was I met a brazilian chick there who was down for whatever. And I do mean *whatever* 😏"
lxp7pdp,No shit cutco was at costco today (south fl)  i almost fell for it back in college they get you good.
lxpah4m,https://youtu.be/ElEIUtzCG7c?si=bvoMXUsgSEd1nYDm
lxpfh4l,Cutco? I sold those senior year of high school. Sliced my thumb pretty good while demonstrating but still have a couple knives and a serving spoon 33 years later.
lxrff34,"They’re overpriced, no question. But my parents have had a set of CUTCO knives for almost 20 years. Those bastards still cut great."
lxsg1lc,The cutco scissors are where it’s at. Worth every penny. My mom has had hers probably close to 20 years and they still work fantastically. When cutco was at Costco this summer I scoured the internet for better kitchen scissors in the price range. General consensus was the knives while good you can get better for about the same but the scissors couldn’t be beat.
lxp4f7j,Ginzu?
lxp5k4s,Yes! The owner of the company I used to work for was so excited because the “sales trainer” he paid 40k to train us for one day sent him a cutco knife as a thank you gift!
lxp8z9e,"I still own a couple of them. They were gifts, lol."
lxpbx83,Those Vaccum salesman too!
lxpdcm7,"A friend of one of my kids was doing that garbage and wanted me to do the appointment. I told him I would give him $20 to NOT to come to my house. He took me up on it, probably the most he made the whole time."
lxpeni5,Oh vector and cutco knifes they are good knifes I still have a set but very scammy and relied on people's family and friends to make sales
lxpfu5f,I do have a Ginsu knife I got 35 years ago and it works a treat.
lxpg6du,My job once! I did that. Shake hands with Cutco!
lxphp4h,"As a matter of fact...yes I had to stop my girlfriend recently from purchasing a new knife set when we have one with more knives of better quality 
Perhaps I should be worried about her interest in sharp metals"
lxpiod9,"Vector, wasn't it?"
lxpjfrj,Vector Marketing which exclusively sells CUTCO knives.
lxpjnuz,"Cutco. They target kids just out of high school/community colleges. It's Vector Marketing over the phone. They won't say their name on the phone when they call to schedule an interview you never asked for.

Had someone I had gone to high school with ""refer"" me to them, because they demand phone numbers, and we had worked on one group project in like 11th grade so he had my number."
lxpl3a1,"Cutco, it’s still around"
lxpoxq5,"Ooh, Cutco/Vector Marketing. I've heard of those guys."
lxpqxpu,"I was looking up recipes recently and only on my second visit to one recipe page did I realize I was getting it off Cutco's website. I guess it's not the end of the world and I'm sure the recipe was fine, but...ew. It felt slimy."
lxpton8,cutco?? YES. My wife and I got an ad for a remote job from them (it obvi wasn’t labeled “cutco”) for broke college students (which we are). Got to scheduling the interview and realized that it was cutco. I see those mfs in costco too
lxpzo26,I had one of those jobs for 2 days. When they told me to bring a check for a set of knives the next day I never went back.
lxq2bgg,"My dad fell into the Cutco trap about 15 years ago. He still has a huge set of those damn things and I hate them. They are some of the worst balanced knives I've ever used, and the santoku knife I bought from a Goodwill for 50¢ holds a better edge for longer. The knife sharpener they gave to sellers kicks ass though, it's genuinely a good product."
lxq695w,"Someone I went to high school with targeted me with the knife set scam. She tried to get me to have a FaceTime meeting with her to discuss buying them and told me the prices were ""eye-watering,"" but they were good knives. First of all, the cost of anything has never once made my eyes water and I hate that dumb phrase, and second, I have a good set of knives, so why the hell would I need another one. I ended up blocking her because she wouldn't leave me alone about them."
lxq8qq9,I still use my demo set from when they tried to get me. I realized it was a scam after they shorted me on my first check lol.
lxqc9u8,My grandpa bought these for my parents and they lasted over a decade
lxqcjt2,Haven't tried em but I've heard the knives are actually good.
lxqo32z,"our local supermarkets are now giving them as ""prizes"" if you collect tons of stickers that you get each 10 or so dollars on your reciept, except the stickers don't even give you the knifes, only 50% discount on them."
lxqwz5j,"OMG one of our local ""politicians"" was running for a seat and BRAGGED about being in Cutco as a top sales representative...  He did not win thank god."
lxr32hg,"It slices. it dices.

Look at that tomato!

You could even cut a tin can with it,

But you wouldn't want to!"
lxr4s65,My college bf worked in Cutco for years. He ended up broke asking me for gas money and then dropping out of college. He defended Cutco up and down through all of this but couldn’t answer where his money was going. I have no idea if he made any money off of it. But my parents helped him out at the beginning and bought me a set of knives. I can’t stand the man but I still had the knives.
lxr942w,My parents have had theirs for 25 years - I’ve had mine for 15! Maybe they’re too good - it seems like they never need to be replaced haha
lxrb60i,"My mother-in-law bought a set of those and when she passed we ended up with the knives.

They were great knives until my kids took them out to the forest and lost them. I’m still mad my wife’s mother-in-law didn’t watch them worth a crap that day."
lxrdrgz,"Omg trying to tell fellow college students this was a scam was always met with great anger 🤣 that Vector ""Marketing Group"" targets dumb young people."
lxrjj44,my cousin had a brief stint as a cutco salesman back in the early 2010s lmaooooo
lxrosf0,"You mean Cutco?

Yes, they're very much still around"
lxroxej,Lol i still have the free spiralizer (that does actually work pretty well) from a demo 10 years ago
lxrqtkt,"I worked for them for a summer between college semesters.

I wouldn't call it a scam to work for them. Everything is laid out plain and simple because they want even the dumbest people to be able to move the product.

One lame part though was I got in trouble for selling to multiple people at once. The session took longer, so it wasn't like I was faking the time I put in and ""stealing"" from the company. Turns out when you get multiple households in the same room, they will instigate each other to buy more stuff. I did more sales in 2 nights of doing presentations that way than I had the 3 weeks prior. They were also more forthcoming with contact info of people to hit up next.

I quit after that though. One thing at jobs I have never been able to stand is being forced to do things inefficiently because ""that's just the way."""
lxruwp0,"I just commented on a different post. I got sucked into the cutco experience in high school. It was horrible and awkward for everyone involved. I'm an introverted, awkward girl. Anyway. Got my demo kit (don't remember how much that bad boy cost me) and lasted about 2 weeks before my anxiety became too much.

However, the knives are very good and I still have my set. So at least they are good products. I just had to send my paring knife out to be repaired, and it's like 20 years old"
lxrvcoh,"I still feel bad for all the people I sold those knives to, not because of the product, but because of the sales tactics and markup. Surprisingly, my mom still has some of the knives, and almost 20 years later, they're still going strong.

I ended up dmropping out of that ""job"" after I went to one of their regional rallies/sales conferences and heard every single speaker get on stage and tell the audience to lie in order to sell more knives. I think the justification was, ""Take anyone else's story, pretend like it's your personal experience, and fake it till you make it."""
lxrzy9d,"The first MLM i attended. Sounded fishy, looked them up online, and saw every link talk about how they are a scam. Vector/Cutco, I believe"
lxs21wt,"I was working a shitty back breaking job when I got referred to some sort of “sales position” by a colleague. I showed up for the interview, it was a knife set company, and by the third slide they had dedicated to “we’re not a pyramid scheme” I said “this is a pyramid scheme”. Thank god they were so shit at hiding it, cause I would’ve done almost anything to quit the job I was working"
lxs2r6b,"God, it was a rite of passage in undergrad to get suckered into meeting their reps once and then bounce because it's a scam. Almost 30 years later, they still paper college campuses with flyers and even write shit on chalkboards in empty classrooms."
lxs83ef,Cutco knifes are top tier though!
lxscj35,"Ah yes, Cutco knives. Worked for them in 1999. I hated the work, but damn, those knives are awesome. So good, I have a few now. The business model is so scammy. But at least what people are getting is a great product that you will use almost daily."
lxskjk4,A couple of years ago someone sold a knife to my fiancé’s mom.
lxskmfl,"If you are talking about Cutco, those are legitimate awesome knives and the lifetime warranty is legit.  Source: My parents bought them in 1982 and still have them"
lxsstjc,"I bought this ridiculous looking ‘as seen on TV’ knife from a cheap shop for under $5. Turns out it’s a pretty good knife😂 but those damn infomercials! Doesn’t matter what they’re selling, I’ll be glued to the TV (not sucked in enough to buy from the TV though, I don’t need 4 sets of whatever for one easy payment). My favourite right now is ‘The Nibbler’ that cuts through ANY metal with ease. I don’t need one, I’m not gunna buy one, but I’m *impressed*😂"
lxstqbo,"Cutco! My wife sold those in college at Madison around 1990. Well, she sold a knife or two. She didn’t last very long. We still have the ones she purchased. They are great knives. We send them in around every other year for free sharpening and they replace some of them for even the slightest bit of normal wear and tear. Our daughter is at university now and received an inquiry about a job with Vector Marketing. We had a fun time explaining what she was looking into."
lxtb8xw,i hate to say it but... those knives slap.
lxtrorx,"Ha! I bought 2 knives from my daughters friend, knew about the MLM aspect of it, but they're good knives and I wanted to give the girl a chance to give her pitch and make a little commish. 

First time using one, sliced halfway through my thumb. 

Went to the ER with bloody towels around my thumb and said ""just got a new knife"" 

The triage nurse said ""Cutco?""

Yep. 

8 stiches."
lxup7w3,Welcome to Cutco
lxvigli,"My ex sold that, he got sales from my family (we were teens and it was his first job) but not a lot elsewhere lol"
lxw705y,I instantly thought about miracle blade 3. i always wanted that knive set as a kid. the way they cut through a pineapple mid air was just freakin awesome and chef toni also played his part...
lxp5rkx,"My daughter's friend, just out of high school, headed to college, almost got suckered into it.  Luckily, he got wise and bailed.  Cutco is unfortunately alive and well."
lxqcm7f,Yes. I know someone from a different state who got into that and tried “recruiting” one of my coworkers recently.

lxp4x1p,"Friend of mine came over one day with his partner to talk to me and mine at the time about an exciting new business opportunity. He seemed like he'd rehearsed the spiel loads, he was confident in what he was selling. And half way through I was like ""nope. Sorry man I'm going to cut you short, we are not interested. I have seen my mum go through too many of those and missed too many meals because of it to be involved with them. Good luck with it and all, but it's not for us."" Didn't give him a chance to come back to it."
lxppm4f,"Like Pampered Chef has some legit stuff, if you didn't have to order it through the MLM structure or for the marked up price the non-MLM sources charge.

Wanna shut down an Amway spiel? ""Sorry, we worship at the church of Costco and aren't interested in converting."""
lxrbuqn,My parents one time agreed to host one so they could get this really fancy serving spoon for free. They conveniently lost the number of the person they were supposed to set it up with and when they'd get calls about it they said wrong number lol. Scam the scam for a free spoon.
lxpyaeb,Didn't Lululemon and Scentsy start out as MLMs?
lxq8a57,You're thinking LuLaRoe and Scentsy is still an MLM
lxqfk7p,"Tupper parties are the OG, the difference being that they actually sold useful stuff. But the principle has always rubbed me the wrong way."
lxrewl5,"Yeah, I wasn't defensive MLMs, just thought it was relevant to the papers chef comment. Looks like a few people took that as me saying that MLMs are a legitimate business, or maybe the down votes are because I confused Lululemon with Lularoe."
lxpdpqg,The word NO is a complete answer. I'd add FUCK OFF if they don't get the gist.
lxqm9vo,"""are you gonna to walk away from financial freedom?"""
lyda08q,"Because I was a decent looking guy, have the gift of gab, and am very personable; I got targeted all the time by MLM people. The number of times Amway people bought me lunch or dinner... they never ate. I am assuming because they could not afford to buy my lunch AND for themselves as well. 

I would always ask them 1) How long have you been a part of this? and 2) How much money have you made?

They always said the same thing, 1) Well, I just got into it recently, and I immediately thought of you. 2) We really arent allowed to talk about how much we have made.

Then I would say, ""BULLSHIT! You have sent the last 20 minutes telling me how much all of these diamonds and whatever have made. About how Sammy Somebitch started last year and is now making $250k/year. You can talk about how much these FEW successful people have made, but not yourself.""

That was when they realized they just bought an asshole who would call them out, a free meal. I was decent enough to leave the tip, and made sure the servers saw it. Just in case they tried to steal the tip from them. 

Seriously, in a 4 or 5 year period of the mid 90s, I got about 15 to 20 free meals a year from these people. I was rakish enough to sleep with a few of the women that were trying to get me into it. But I told them I wasnt interested in the MLM BS first."
lxrbkar,MlMs almost killed my relationship with my mom.
lxph224,"My college friend took me to a coffee shop one day only to be ganged up by a team of pyramid sellers. They talked big about making a lot of money but when they didn't even offer to buy me a coffee (even though the waiter asked), I knew they had to be lying."
lxq3ub2,"Same back in high school. It just smells fishy all around the moment you step in. It wasn't even an event hall or meeting room. It was just someone's living room. After the event, I was honest with him and told him it smelled like a scam, but he still went for it. Didn't even last half a year there, and he lost a few hundred dollars for the starting kit. Idk how people even fall for that crap when it was just screaming red flags."
lxq876p,"As unemployed I reached out to my network to see if someone knew something. 
A lady at the outskirts had a thing. 
So she took me to a meeting.

Some Salesbitch of a woman talking about how the leader was such a good guy. And the bitch was talking about how her dad was so suspicious but after talking to the leader, her dad was convinced!!! And her dad was here and he was some sort of hot shot.

I. Was. Fuming. 
I could be out in the soul-sucking world of geting a job. A paying job. A real job!
MLM force you to buy stuff. It is not based on customer demand! I hated this.

I just wanted to drag the woman who got me there out. Bit she was all ""I want that corner-office!""

I wanted to scream at the Salesbitch. Do I look like I care about you, your dads opinion or want to pay to work?!?

Yes... I'm still pissed.

On the other hand I once got a hold of some really good products from MLM. I still don't get why those just don't do normal sales. The products were solid.
Needkess say, no did not join that either."
lxqxufo,"Oh man, I had one of those. I got a call asking if I was still looking for a job. Got the company name, general job description, I said yeah sure, ill go check it out. Huh, a paint company? Dont know much about paint, but I guess? Turns out, nope. They were in the basement area of the paint store building, running a ""financial advisory"" business. Was just a taaaad suspicious how much they kept emphasising that you should only think of how much money you would be making with this job, and by the way, your pay will always be two months late due to national bank rules. Needless to say, I am still not driving a Ferrari. Xd

OVB, in case anyone still thinks of doing business with/working with them... if they still exist anyway."
lxr4ni5,"That's unfortunately a very good audience for this type of a scam. A lot of them have done crap jobs and had to endure with shitty bosses and horrible customers. Then the idea of 'be your own boss!' is dangled before them, with pictures of mercedes benzes and exotic holidays they can have when they sign up for this surefire way to make insane money. Naturally no one's asking howcome more people aren't doing it if it was supposedly so well paid."
lxqli3d,"I was invited to one. I came prepared with a list of pre-googled info on the company and put the asshole on blast (after the free meal that was promised, of course). Still sad to see that there were several old people falling for the scam, despite me literally telling the sales critter that they were lying about this ""150 year of German noble pedigree"" the company had, when it was in fact founded 15 years ago in the Netherlands. Didn't matter, still granny felt the mattress was a good deal for them."
lxr1g6e,"The summer of my freshman year of college I was looking for a job and went to a group interview for what turned out to be Cutco Knives. I hadn't heard of them before and spent 20min listening to the pitch. Once I realized what was up I told the 6 other people in the interview what their deal was and that it was a scam. Everyone, save one guy got up and left.

I had nothing better going on so I hung out outside the storefront the interviews were taking place in and explained to every person why it was a scam and that they would charge you $100+ just to buy a set of the knives that you would use to try to scam other people. I got at least 5-6 more people to turn around. After about 1.5hrs the guy that did the first interview came out and told me I pissed off his boss (apparently one of the people I tried to talk sense into) and he gave me $100 to go away lol."
lxrgii5,"A few friends and I went to an Amway thing while we were in college. The way they sell it to you, makes it sound appealing, but the reality is that some crazy number like 96% of people that get involved don’t even break even. Called my mom about this “new opportunity” of me making money and she basically was like don’t be stupid and don’t get involved. I’m so thankful I listened to her."
lxrih8v,"lol my ex father in law wanted me to get involved in his gold MLM.  
the gist of it was you buy a gram and then resell it.. 

i was oh! that sounds really interesting..  are you selling it for spot? or is it a little higher? 

he goes 
>whats spot?

i then informed him i was not interested. If his documentation didnt even include a primer on what spot was, then it was a scam.

lxruowx,"When I was going through training at Great Lakes Naval Training Center, there was always a bunch of ""jam"" vans outside the side gate waiting to pick people up. Mostly to take groups of sailors to Gurnee Mills. One time, there was a different van from some financial institution. They were collecting groups of people who were interested in going to their office to talk about annuities. To be honest, the only reason I went was because I was bored and they promised free donuts."
lxs1kkh,"About 15 years ago I had two different people call me around the same time about a pyramid scheme that involved buying crap in bulk..   (within a few weeks of each other) and I declined both of them and said it wasn't for me.  I was single at the time why would I need huge boxes of cereal and toilet paper . Plus it was all off brand stuff (which some things you can get away with but some I just can't do the off brand)

Anyway a few weeks later I saw an ad somewhere about making extra money part time, it was vague but I figured I'd look into it.   I met with some lady to discuss at a coffee shop after work,  and she said there was a big meeting they were going to in like 1/2 hour at a local hotel to discuss more details.  

Still super vague I really I had no idea what was going on but figured I didn't have anywhere else to be so I agreed to go.

So I get to this big meeting and as soon as I walk in I see BOTH of the people trying to recruit me earlier and I immediately knew what it was before the presentation started.. of course the presentation was what it was since I already heard the schtick from both of the other people before.  I guess it was even more detail in what I had already heard before .   But yeah I should have just walked out as soon as I saw them but did stick around for the presentation before declining and leaving.."

Grown ass man sits next to me and starts acting like we're great friends, and he wants me to work for him. I can meet him at the gyro place at 8 and we can talk about it and he'll buy me dinner. Cool!

Knowledge of MLMs wasn't even close to as common and widespread as it is today, but it was out there for sure.

I personally didn't have a ton of knowledge about MLMs, but I was raised in an environment where I learned at a young age that if it sounds too good to be true, it is. 

Oh boy, was it obviously some bullshit.. can't remember which one it was, but I clocked him SO fast. I kept playing along, though, because I was hungry, and it was fascinating to me that he thought I wasn't seeing right through him. 

When he finished, I asked him if he was really ignorant enough to believe everything he just told me, or if he was trying to prey on a desperate college student. I said it nicely and offered to explain to him how he was being scammed if he truly believed the stuff he had just said to me. 

Framed it as if I cared for his well-being and didn't want him to continue to be scammed, but we both knew. 

He called ME an asshole! Woah there! Sorry I didn't let you scam me lol

I did get a free gyro and fries tho"
lxqtrzj,"The lure of free money gets bites across the income scale:

I had one of my buddies from law school try to recruit me into an Amway scheme.  Had clearly been coached by some other shmuck with a whole shpiel about gold bars and heart-felt desires.  Even had some half-assed modern twist about using the internet to cut out the middle-man.

I told him to send me the link and that I'd buy something if there were actual bargains to be had.  But I wasn't going to go round recruiting anyone to funnel money up the chain.

I was honestly kind of shocked he was dumb enough to fall for it in the first place, but there you go."
lxqzvow,"I once saw my aunt nearly get into what I'm pretty sure was a straight up Ponzi scheme, not even an MLM (I say 'pretty sure' because it was years back and I didn't even know about Ponzi/pyramid schemes then, just thought the logic of it was off). And she wasn't stupid or greedy! but it was sold to her as some kind of solidarity thing, like a, idk, mutual aid fund or mutual credit thing... Nefarious stuff."
lxvx38r,"I'll pile on to tell my story too:

Fresh out of college, I was looking for work. I got invited to come interview for a manager position. I had some supervisor experience, so it sounded good. I went to an office park nearby, and reception led me into a conference room. I said there may be a mistake, I'm here to meet with Mr. Blahblah. They said yes, Mr. Blahblah is leading the presentation.

I realized pretty quickly this was a MLM scheme. Everyone in the audience was so enthusiastic and into it. I was just getting a real creepy vibe, so I stood up and started to walk out. The host asked where I was going, the presentation just started. I just said it's not for me, thanks anyway.

I was sitting in my car and called my friend to tell him how bonkers this was. Just a minute later all the ""audience"" came out the front door. I realized they were all acting, and I was the target all along."

They would often agree and followup because it meant them serving serious jail time as well as loosing their trades license on top of legal fees as well."
lxq8nke,"I hate to break it to you, but you got scammed listening to this.  The laws for radio changed decades ago, and ever since then, a radio station needs your permission to play your voice and any recordings of your voice on the air.

They can't call and pretend to be someone else.  Legally, they have to tell you immediately that you are  live on the air with a radio station.

So, all of those calls were fake.  They usually use interns or off air employees that want to have a little fun.  The same goes for all the ""prank"" calls they do, and the relationship ones, all of it.  None of them are real."

lxse6vr,"There were also A LOT of Z and B every single number radio stations. Three popular ones were z&b 100, z&b 104 and z&b 94. It's the way that it rolls off the tongue. 

Yes, the first one that you get when you search is New York. But there's that main character syndrome again. If you insist that I need to know that that's New York, then you assume that I've lived anywhere near New York. There are lots of z100s all over the place and only people who believe they're the central figure in everybody else's narrative think that we should automatically know what they're talking about. 

Basically the people who argue with this have a self-centered personality, and the people who are going ""omg finally somebody said it,"" don't.  It doesn't mean anything, it's just that some people are more self-centered than others. This is a red flag when somebody automatically assumes that you should know what they're talking about when they use one of these colloquialisms and gets angry because you don't. And I mean that in the sense of I was a trained psych nurse and when somebody acts like this, it points towards a pathology.

 The difference between a pathology and just a dysfunctional form of communication is when you point it out to somebody, if they CAN'T correct it or stop doing it, or understand that it's even dysfunctional, that points to a pathology. Pathology means it's being caused by something that is medically wrong with them.  

But honestly, people don't know that they're doing it if you don't point it out to them. So you have to give them the chance to stop doing it by pointing it out."

That's what I'm saying is dysfunctional- You're using gauges that not everybody uses and expecting us all to know what you're talking about. And you're up in here down voting everything and responding defensively. Feeling some kind of way, obviously.

And I've never lived around New York & New Jersey. Plus, I love to road trip all over the US. I've driven across country seven times. I've been in a lot of hotels and turned on the television and heard the local news say ""the tri-state area.""

It's a colloquialism that's used on television and radio stations when three states come together and they serve that area. People assume that you mean New York because of its very dense population and New York being popular all over the world, so that's technically the most popular one. 

But I knew a girl in the military from I want to say it was Tennessee and she referred to ""going back to the tri-state area."" She acted like I was an idiot not knowing that she was talking about like Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia. I'm like honey, there's a lot of Tri-State areas. The one that you are from is not THE tri-state area.

  I was a psych nurse. I was trained in therapeutic communication.  I was taught to ask questions of people that force them to clarify statements in a way that makes them realize how dysfunctional or pathologic their communication is. It's a psych technique. This main character syndrome, where somebody assumes that everybody should know what they're talking about because they're the main character in everybody's story, is a thing that people with personality disorders do a lot.  A lot of perfectly healthy people do it too. I was just trained to point it out so that people realize they're doing it, and doing so in a non-threatening manner."
lxrb472,I've never heard the tri state referred to any other region than the north east it's typically only refers to NY-NJ-PA/CT where else is it used ?
lxrceau,"That term gets thrown around locally literally everywhere that three states meet. As a Kentuckian, I don’t even know which tri-state area people are referring to in my own state when they do that. There’s multiple."
lxri2pd,I'm sure colloquially but in most of the corporate world tri state refers to the NY surrounding area
lxrm6gu,"Because you’re from that area I assume. I’ve honestly never even thought of it as one of the tri-states in the country until this exchange. It’s just New York City-New Jersey.

Edit:
Now that Jake responded I can edit this to say of course I’ve heard of New York City as part of a tri-state area. But sometimes you have to pretend to not know terribly obvious things about New York to mess with their defaultism."
lxrnw3z,I work for a international bank so it's not just where im from that tri state is referred to as NY. Other corporations mean the greater NY area when they say the tri state
lxsgn45,🚩🚩🚩🚩
lxtxc69,In ky that means Indiana ohio and ky
lxu3eb6,"Greater Cincinnati is indeed the marquee tri-state area Kentucky is lumped into. If you’re in central/northern Kentucky, that’s what you’ll think of.

Where KY, OH and WV converge in the Huntington, WV orbit, you get a bunch of river towns that will be the tri-state area for anyone that direction.

And if you’re in the southeastern Appalachian part of the state, the Cumberland Gap area near Middlesboro, KY where KY, TN and VA meet up is the one you’ll think of. You will definitely find your fill of businesses in Kentucky and Tennessee calling themselves Tri-State So-and-So over there.

And I have no idea if there’s much tri-state identity going on for KY-IN-Il, KY-IL-MO or KY-MO-TN meeting areas. Anything west of I-65 in Kentucky is a mystical land I only hear about during weather reports or election season."
lxrm9k6,"I’ve heard it used to refer to PA/MD/WV, but like the other person said, it’s used literally everywhere 3 states meet, so online it’s very ambiguous."
lxrymgq,"> I've never heard the tri state referred to any other region than the north east

Because you haven't lived near any other tri state regions, lmao."
lxsxc7x,"We have a five state region - South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Montana and Wyoming."
lxv52lm,You mean tornado alley lol
lxs2ddd,"I have and have never heard it before other than reference to NY. Never heard it used in MD, FL, DC, or CA. 

Have friends that live in Chicago and in New England as well as Texas never heard them call any other region the tri-state. More often I hear metro in DC/MD."
lxueucn,"DELMARVA is one. Delaware, Maryland, Virginia. I’m sure they’re all over."
lxv4pfu,Never heard that one when I was in Maryland or DC
lxwz39r,"It’s closer to PA, which is where I live. Exelon, the largest electric company in the US, even calls their subsidiary in that area “Delmarva Power.” It’s definitely a thing. Feel free to google."
lxxs7kx,It's not that I doubt it just never heard it before lived in PA as well for sometime.
lxruzsn,This is specifically the Tri-State area Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz lives in and pays HOA fees to.
lxs3704,"Phineas and Ferb being set in ""the fictional city of Danville in an unspecified tri-state area"" is akin to The Simpsons being set in Springfield."
lxrkc2t,"Exactly. I've heard just about every region of the US call themselves a tri-state area.

***EDIT  Damn there's a [wiki page for it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-state_area) and by golly there's a lot of 'em"
lxrp131,Yes! Thank you!
lxraff9,Typically the Tri-State refers to NY-NJ-PA/CT
lxreo0k,"Usually it's NY because nobody except a NYer assumes their particular area, which isn't unique for having 3 states together and in fact is ambiguous and could be 4 states, is the only ""tri-state"" anyone would want to talk about. See also: ""the city""."
lxricce,"Tri state is not in reference to three states it's a triangular grid with 3 market points of interest and the region between it, think of the Bermuda triangle"

lxp5kx0,Had one who after I pointed to the no soliciting sign and declined their offer of a free estimate asked if I could spare any change.  Like wtf?
lxrgief,"A lot of shady contractor companies ""hire"" people in very dire straights on a fee-only basis. (No hourly wage, just a fee for every customer they bring in.)"
lxspw5t,These looked like yuppie kids to be honest.
lxtilq2,"The majority of people in dire straights don't look like the ""homeless guy"" stereotype. People living on the street is certainly a real thing, but most people who are homeless or close to homeless look like... well, kind of like ""yuppie kids"", actually.

I've certainly been in a place where I was without a job long enough that I did ""street hustles"" and asked people for spare change. I was living out of a backpack and crashing on friends' couches as I could, so while I had safe places to sleep and access to showers and such, I was homeless. When I went for interviews, I borrowed a suit. I took a shitty, exploitative job (selling magazine subscriptions) because I needed _something_. The company that hired me gave me a decent haircut and a uniform, and you'd have never known I was homeless when I showed up at your door."
lxtssf6,Fairly certain homeless people don’t have an iron available to them.  They generally don’t have neat haircuts.  And they generally aren’t wearing expensive clean shoes.  I am not a complete idiot.  Just an incomplete one.
lxz3spa,"So I just told you a story about being homeless where I absolutely had all of those things and your answer is ""no, I know better"". What a clown."
lxq10m0,"Someone came by my dad’s house and did this. He was “working in the neighborhood.” 

The guy had all these big promises about how if he can’t get the work done a certain way it’d be free, and that he can get their homeowners insurance to cover it entirely.

My dad did the research. *it turns out this guy was legit.* He actually just wanted the business. They finished the work on time, as promised, and got my dad’s homeowner’s insurance to pay for all of it. 

I’m glad my dad didn’t get scammed but I was like “aww man, what are you doing providing an exception to this scam?!” And now here I am sharing it 😅 I can’t believe this was real."
lxrhadg,"A lot of scams are sketchy people copying legitimate business/sales activities and then just absconding with the money (or doing a shit job or whatever).

The whole ""we're in the neighborhood"" thing started out entirely legitimately as a way to expand business. You're doing siding in a neighborhood? Send a foreman/sales guy driving around looking for other people nearby who could use siding, because hey ""your neighbor Bob is getting his siding done with us, see?"" is basically a light reference. Works well because presumably you think Bob has decent judgement. 

And because it works great, scammers have realized that they can lie about it and still have it work a fair percentage of the time."
lxr2eqx,"If it's for concrete work or anything needing heavy equipment you can actually get a good deal if they're working in the neighborhood since it let's them save on trips.

When I got my driveway done my neighbor got his done by the same contractor and he cut us a deal because of it."
lxrn6tx,"I had something similar happen, we had a roof with recalled shingles and AFAIK the people knocking on our doors were legitimately working in the area. And the reason I know that they were probably telling the truth about the shingles being recalled is that multiple people kept knocking on our door to tell us about them being recalled.

It seems that in this case it might not be a scam, and the scammers are just trying to blend in with the legit people."
lxrv0b5,"I had that happen and got ~25 year old roof replaced by insurance for that.

Basically where i live you by law insurance has to be able to replace the shingles with matching ones. In this case the shingles are recalled and can't be replaced. So you get a new roof and the guys driving around get a bunch of houses.

So companies will drive around after a wind event looking for older roofs with recalled shingles. There will always be some roof damage on old roofs so when an adjuster comes out they can't really contest it

Its been 6 years without leaks so i guess they did a decent enough job. They also didnt take payment until work was being done / after it was done."
lxp5a2q,"Just had this happen at my grandma’s house. Thankfully I was visiting and told him no. 

He was “working on a neighbor’s house and noticed our windows looked old.”"

lxpjlfg,John? Maybe Juan or Won. You're in the wrong neighborhood bro.
lxqw7tg,"I had some kid trying to sell windows, legit company just shitty sales people, come up to me as I'm working in the yard and go "" It looks like your windows are kind of old, would you be interested in new high efficiency ones?"" 

I looked at him and went ""Which windows? You mean the ones I replaced this summer? You're just gonna walk up and insult my house to try to sell your windows?"" The kid was mortified. He had no response. I was like I know you were given a script but just don't use it if the windows don't actually look old."
lxrn1er,I had some AT&T rep at target tell me that my provider sucks and to change to theirs. Like fuck you for insulting my choice of phone company
lxrmo70,I feel bad for him...

lxq7015,"My grandma got conned by some guys doing this, although it was a long time ago. They offered to replace the driveway at her house and she agreed to it, and they basically destroyed it. By the time my dad found out about it and tried to track the guys down who did it, they were long gone."
lxpd7mz,Human popup ads.
lxrv9vh,"I am stealing this, thank you!"
lxt4u4z,"Share and Enjoy. It's literally true... They interrupt what you're doing, you generally don't want what they're selling, and more often than not they're actively malicious.

lxpg2ct,"Yeah, I had some travelers insist my trees needed to be pruned because of fire codes and they’d report me if I didn’t hire them. I told them to knock themselves out because no one can get hold of the permits department in my city."
lxpv5fc,"My landlord had the roof replaced and not too long after I got a knock on the door from a different roofing company that just happened to be driving down the street and just happened to notice that my roof was in very poor condition and it desperately needed to be replaced before the next rain storm.  Coincidentally, he was offering a discount and if I could move my car so he could set up a ladder he'd offer me a free estimate.  I needed to make a decision in the next few moments while he went to his truck to get the paperwork.

I just played kinda stupid and told him I'm just had work done on it but I'll have to call the landlord and so on.  He didn't look happy but left me with his card and left."

lxpoiva,"A contractor came out to my rural store that got a lot of parking lot traffic unrelated to my business (\*grumble\*) and offered to fix up the highway ramps for a stupid low price.

I was aware of the scams but the price was good and it didn't have to be *that* good of a job, I really just needed some material down (with transportation, gravel that I spread by hand would have cost more), but they did a fantastic job.

I guess they really were highway contractors with extra asphalt they didn't want to have to pay to dump."
lxpwfiy,In Michigan there was a serial killer targeting women that started each interaction with offering to clean their gutters.
lxq4e9t,"Some guy knocked on my door last week doing this, asking did I need the gutters cleaned and the front of the house washed. Now, fair play, I actually HAD been intending to ring a local company about it.

He quoted me €100, which was more than I knew I'd pay the company, so I said I'd chat with my wife about it and asked for their card so I could ring them. No cards, had to be today. He asked how much I'd be willing to pay, I told him (truthfully) I had no cash in the house. Ok, but could I GET cash today? I said no. He gave me his phone number and said to ring as soon as I spoke with my wife, but I had to ring TODAY.

I did not."
lxp7fa4,We had the driveway scammers make the rounds the last couple of summers.  At best they do a shiity job.. sometimes they just take the deposit and disappear.. and sometimes they tear out some of the driveway and never come back.
lxpgb3r,Haven't heard of this one. How does it work ? What's their endgame ?
lxpebq6,“I’ve pressure washed a lot of your neighbors houses”….every damn year right after pollen season
lxqemxu,"I nearly fell for the energy company version of this, but my dog hates strangers being on the front porch, so he was barking his head off the whole time. And I was like “I’m sorry… my dog… is there a way I could do this online? What was the company name again? Yeah I know you could do it now, but you see, my dog… He just doesn’t like strangers…”

And the guy was then like, “Um don’t worry about it. Just forget it” and basically RAN away

Alright. Thank you to my anxious dog for getting me out of that one"
lxqwoon,"A few years ago we had a hail storm and a company came through knocking on doors to tell people they needed their roof fixed.  A lot fell for it and after paying discovered their insurance wouldn't cover it because they didn't go through insurance first.  Well, just had a hurricane come through and every single one of those houses had their roof leak.  None of them needed the new roof in the first place.  And where is that company?  Gone.  Nowhere to be found.  My spouse tried to warn people but they wouldn't listen."
lxp5ysq,Those asphalt/concrete ones can be legit. It's going to go to waste if they don't unload it.
lxp9d1h,"""We got a flat tyre so we need to get this asphalt unloaded ASAP! We'll do your whole driveway for a quarter of the normal price!""  
It will be the thinnest asphalt you've ever known and will fall to pieces in no time"
lxrhm4q,"Yeah, bullshit excuses is a red flag. But ""hey, we're coming next week and doing three houses in your area, so we'll offer you a discount if you want yours done too"" can be a legit win-win, as the cost of transport is so high for some things."
lxpnzgw,"You need to know your area's scam season, and check if they're bonded, insured, and licensed in your state in the off-season. If I see women and children with accents begging outside grocery stores, I know it's scam season and their husband/father is out running an asphalt or tree service scam while the mom and kids are out begging. Lotta those fuckers live in McMansions and make waaaaaaaaay more money that I ever will. Those fuckers travel up to my Northern state from the South when the weather gets warm down South."
lxqb198,"We had a woman who'd lay out a blanket in the Aldi cart cove with a baby on it doing this. People will get upset if you criticize her because she's just begging for food or loose change, but the reality is she's looking for bigger payouts where they buy her a car or rent her a place to live with a 3rd party who is in on it"
lxp3y1a,Why
lxp6qtn,"Lots of shady contractors demand payment upfront usually from elderly individuals, do the demo and never come back to complete the job. Happens way more than you think across the U.S. and most these people are stupid enough as well to use their real identity or business logo to scam these people.

 It's predatory not to mention shady contractors can also rob your place. My landlord had plumbing work done on an old college apartment I was living in years ago and the assistant plumber still had the keys to our apartment and stole my mountain bike while i was still in the house sleeping! it was probably worth 2k at the time and even though I reported it the landlord didn't wanna give the police the name of the plumbers because he regularly contracted them for cheap!"
lxp5wph,"Because 10 times out of 10, someone showing up at your door to do work on your house is scamming you. They’ll have you sign some official-looking-but-actually-bullshit paperwork, demand payment up front, go hire a day laborer from the nearest home improvement store for a fraction of what they’re making, make that guy do all the work while they sit in a truck watching, will usually try and escalate scope or materials pricing and demand cash to make those purchases up front (another tip: be familiar with rough material costs - these guys love to charge 10x for people who don’t know any better). 

The big one is that if something goes wrong with work they’ve done, say someone gets hurt walking up masonry steps, or something like that, they’re not a real company and can’t be held responsible. 

They’ve gotten super lazy lately too - the easiest tell is out-of-state plates and trucks with no branding on them. All contractor trucks should have their licensing info on it somewhere. If the truck is clean of any kind of business tags, immediate suspicion."
lxri50t,"In addition to what others have said, often its a way to get you ""on the hook"" for more money. They'll quote you $50 to pressure wash your house and then ""oh, man, we noticed this thing that needs repair; we can do that for you for $500"" and either it's entirely bullshit or _they actually broke it_.

Or they'll ""I noticed your front walk needed it, so I went ahead and did that too, so actually you owe me $200"", and if you don't pay it'll be threats and ""I'll put a lien on your house"" and other stuff that works surprisingly well on a lot of people."
lxpmcg4,"I never expected them to call me. Claiming my roof was old and needed replacing (it's 7 years old and still looks brand new). 

Wasn't even a spam number."
lxpnyyw,"Especially love the ones who say ""Okay well I'll come back in a week"" I actually cut off the kid saying that mid sentence with ""No you wont"" and I followed him off my driveway. I'm no a scary looking guy, I look like a dork, but it worked."
lxpokfd,"My mother did this once for someone who was sealing driveways or something.

Dude sealed her driveway and I'm pretty sure it all washed off a couple weeks later when we got a really hard rainstorm."
lxpywzt,"You gave me quite the chuckle, because that ""We're working in your area"" thing is so true! Seriously, what actual contractor would ever say that?!"
lxqi1hy,Or the related “we were in the area delivering steak to restaurant X but they were unable to pay/over ordered/ closed and we can’t return because boss/health department rules/truck is at the end of the route and we have a deal on frozen ribeye/filet/t-bone steak”. “Steak” turns out to be expired meat or incredibly low quality that the buyer won’t find out about until it thaws.
lxqmqsp,this is a menace with insta having many such videos​
lxqu55p,"I've seen a lot of these fellas doing window cleaning and roof work free of charge because the neighbors has hired them and will do some work for free. 

It's mostly young white American people that creates these YouTube shorts so be careful when you get approached by these types of folks asking to clear up your driveway and such"
lxqwiiw,"> “Contractors”

Pretty much every single driveway contractor. Asphalt needs very heavy and hot equipment. The cheap crews will slap shit down that breaks up within a few months."
lxrce97,"Theres a routine scam in my neck of the woods: Some dude is gonna show up and say he needs to check your attic for whatever reason.

Its only an excuse to walk in and then figure if you are a good mark to come rob.

Most hilarious was when the dude said he was from a government program I just spent months on a waiting list to have an appointment. Sure, it takes months to get an appointment but someday they will just come and knock at your door!"
lxrga1z,"On the flip side, there are reputable companies who do offer discounts for certain services on a particular week/whatever so they can save trip costs.

The driveway sealing place I've used for years always sends a card round for the week they want to do stuff in our neighborhood, and its 15% off that week. It's win-win -- a bunch of us do take them up on it when we're in need of service, they do a great job, we save some money, an they probably save way more than the discount by doing a handful of drives in the same area all at once rather than randomly driving all over."
lxrghx4,"I had TruGreen and some pest control company show up and try to pull this. ""We're working with Dan next door and wanted to let you know you can get a group deal since your neighbors have already signed up."" I dont think the dude next door is even named Dan. Then when i tell them i'm not interested they pull the ""well just sign up now and no money is due for three weeks. You can cancel anytime before then so there's nothing to lose!"" I basically had to just shut the door in their faces"
lxrgmvm,"A similar scam is when there actually are workers in an area (for example, washing windows or mowing lawns), someone who's not affiliated with them will dress like them and go around knocking on houses ""Hi, we're doing XYZ services in your neighborhood today (point to them currently working at a different house), would you like this done on your house too? Cost is $X."" and then collect payment and leave."
lxrmsey,I hate when people show up and tell them they're from the electric company and need to see your bill. And then they change providers on you and you're suddenly paying so much more for utilities
lxrnwo5,"It's good to hear this is a scam. I've had these folks stop at my house a dozen times since buying it, and always took their offer at face value. I never trusted them to do work on my house, though."
lxro980,had to tell one of these guys several times thru a closed door to leave the property - came to spray for spiders at 7pm. He got quite aggressive and really wouldn’t take no for an answer - ended up emailing his company bc he kept asking me “do u even know who I work for” - so his spraying company got a complaint from me with his name . I still don’t know if he was legit or not but very aggreasive
lxrq1vq,"Shoot, somehow these guys keep calling my phone about that!"
lxrqzj5,"""Oh, hi! We're putting in new windows for your neighbor on \[two streets away -- they know damn wall I'm not going to know them\], would you be interested in an estimate?"" 

Never get the estimate! You'll be screening those calls for years to come.

I've lost track of the number of times I've explained that ""I just got laid off, we're probably going to get foreclosed on"" to random salespeople. And those guys will still keep trying to talk to me! (My go to, in general, with people trying to scam or sell me is ""I'm dying"" or ""I'm poor"" -- I don't GAF, I'll traumatize them.)"
lxrt6x0,I ask which house and the can never tell me which.
lxry5y2,"Years ago, my neighbor gave $40K to a contractor for an addition to their home.  Contractor promptly declared bankruptcy and ended his LLC.  Not the first time he had done that, either.

Yes, they did our driveway but my friend who works said it looked pretty subpar.  I filed with the Secretary of State's office and he called and was PISSED.  I laid into him saying that's not legit, it's even on the SoS website it is a common scam, he has no online presence and it's a shitty way to do business."
lxsid1h,"There was a ""company"" doing driveways in my area with that scam. Law enforcement agencies got a hold of them and 4 of them got deported back to Mexico because they were wanted there.  How they made to Canada before being caught, I have no idea."
lxsk33y,"Had to get some siding work done a year or so ago and we were considering just replacing all of it instead of a few trashed panels.  
Searched for companies and even checked to see if they were licensed/insured/etc and contacted a few for quotes.  
One guy responded and could come by the same day, so I let him poke around and at one point realized he'd climbed up on to the roof.  
He finishes poking around and proceeds to tell me my roof is shot to hell from hail, shows me pics of the ""damage"", but he can get insurance to cover a replacement for free!  Also trying to get a quote on the siding work was like pulling teeth from a tiger, when I finally got one it was 2x what anyone else wanted.  
I foolishly signed some paperwork letting him talk to my insurance about it but also told him I'm expecting more companies to come by for quotes.  He still put in the claim request, but basically ghosted me and in the mean time the other companies came by and the second company quickly called BS on the first.  Even showed me around the roof pointing out the ""damage"" the first guy was talking about, which was maybe 3 tiny dents and the rest was just manufacturing defects.  
Talked to insurance about the claim, cancelled it, and even shared with them details about what I'd been told and observed.  
  
Moral of the story; A company can be licensed/insured/etc with a lot of good reviews and still be a scammy den of assholes."
lxso3ss,Scam contractors are qualified in all those things but if you hire someone that has to go door-to-door to find work you deserve to be scammed
lxspr0t,Had one for roofing after a storm. Vetted him on the spot for about ~45 and discussed plans and materials. Guy was legit local business but just starting off as a gen contractor. In the middle of it another showed up that was more front of professional and scammer on work. It's hilarious to watch a scammer squirm out when they're marked during conversation.

lxt8lxy,"I always love the ""we've been working in your neighborhood"" line. I'm home most of the time during the day, so I always just ask them ""where/when. I've been home all day and haven't seen a thing"" watching them squirm and stumble to their next line is kind of satisfying. After that I just stonewall them with ""not interested"" until they get off my property."
lydbdl8,"We got a new roof last summer. It looked (still looks amazing) With a highly reputable company in my area and we knew SEVERAL other people who recommended them. 

Right after a storm (roof still looked, and still looks brand new) we got 4 different people knocking at our door saying that they noticed how old our roof was from the road and they were working in our area. SO thy thought they would do the neighborly thing and give discounts to anyone in the neighborhood who signed up with them today. 

They almost all had the same story. Like exact same. 

And sadly, one neighbor around the corner used one of these scammers. The next bad storm (like 3 weeks after their roof was finished) they had really bad roof leaks and so forth. 

Our neighbors across the street (3 different houses worth) all recommended the folks we chose. Two sets had theirs done over 8 years ago, and they still look like it was done last month.

They are obvious to spot when you haven't made a delivery, but when you just recently made one and you get a message from the same delivery company you are expecting a parcel from and it doesn't ask for any details, just to press some link, it becomes easy to fall for.

I think if I wasn't a fan of 'scam' content on youtube, I would have fallen for it but instead a few alarm bells began ringing so I copied the email and independently looked up a customer fraud/service address for that company to ask them if this was legitimate or not.

I told him it was a scam but he said he was fairly sure it wasn't because nobody would go to that sort of length for just $2.   
I explained that as soon as he gives them his credit card details they would be taking a lot more than $2 but he didn't understand as he started talking about how $2 isn't much, but if they are doing it to a lot of people then that could add up to a lot.

They just happened to mention during a conversation that they had stopped at the post office and dropped off the $2 redelivery fee because they didn't think they had paid for the package they got that day. And I stopped and asked what redelivery fee...which opened the door to me giving a lesson on..how to actually verify website URLs...why is USPS texting you if you didn't sign up for updates.. redelivery is free....if you don't recognize a tracking number in a random text take a second to think - why would a package marked international have a country code in the tracking that is your own country? USPS is also not going to text you that an address doesn't match - because how are they going to know who it goes to and the number to text? 


I even went into more nuanced things that are super obvious to me but get overlooked - we are in the US. We do not refer to it as courier. There were a couple other language mismatches. Plus how to read a phone number and see that it's international - why would USPS be texting from an international number?


They then had to inform several other friends it was all fake and to contact their banks because they've all been paying these fees and responding to these texts with their info."
lxrnsxg,"> why would USPS be texting from an international number

Unfortunately, most companies use these generic numbers like 85115 or whatever for these ""automated text systems"", so it's not necessarily unusual to see weird numbers."

>non-tech-savvy a lot of real world people are, especially the older generations. 

I'm saying people of all generations, ESPECIALLY the older ones. Just because you ""grew up with technology"" doesn't mean you know a lot about it. In fact, studies show that the easier technology becomes to use, the ""dumber"" the general society is about it, because the bar to entry is a lot lower."

And if that wasn’t bad enough, she did the same thing a few months later and lost another $7k.

lxqdo6p,"My mom signed up sadly.  She got one in Florida 30+ years ago.  Ask me how many times we have been?  Zero.  We have traded it and had some great vacations and now that travel is so expensive it seems like a bit of a better deal than it used to IF we used our week at our timeshare...but we have to pay to belong to RCI so we can use a different week at other places we are more interested in.  So we pay for the fees every year for upkeep of our place near Orlando.  We pay to belong to RCI and then every week we book at another place, we pay around $250 I think to book that new place.  PLUS she had to pay for the week (I think that was approx $20K in 1993).  If she REALLY needed a time share, should have booked the nicest timeshare that we could easily drive a couple hours to THEN we could join RCI once every couple of years (maybe fore a few years at a time since the cost is less if you do that).  My mom is not wealthy...and when she dies, whomever becomes executor of her will is responsible for this unless she wills it to someone I am pretty sure.  The only thing that is good is that she has a good week at a great resort near Disney so we seem to get the best units at timeshares (I make sure we never go to an even remotely low end one)...but were kinda forced to use these things almost every year.  We've def wasted a few weeks when we couldn't go.  SUCH A SCAM.  There are some people they kinda work out for, but it's not like a true asset, and that should say all you need to know.  People pay to get rid of these things and I bet they are MUCH HARDER to sell then they have ever been.  If politicians weren't all crooked AF, they would be outlawed."
lxqla7d,"When she dies I believe that any responsibility goes with her, including any debts. You shouldn't need to worry about paying anything."
lxp1sik,"I don’t understand what exactly a time share is, even? Like why on earth would people have done that? Was there a benefit?"
lxp3bkg,"The idea of a timeshare is fantastic. It's the execution and the predatory nature of literally every seller that is the problem. 

Like, say you love baseball and the escaping to the beach. So every year you leave your freezing cold winter wherever and you had two weeks at a nice place, that's always the same, in sunny Florida during Spring Training. 

But you don't have to worry about anything else besides those two weeks. The rest of the up keep and everything is handled. It's your own comfortable personal hotel room. 

No matter what is happening at home or work, nothing matters. In two weeks you get to go watch baseball and nap on the beach!

But the problem is the people who sell you those two weeks are fucking assholes with insanely complicated contracts.

The idea is wonderful. But like everything, the people ruin it."
lxp3mzr,But isn’t that the same as a …hotel? Or even an air bnb? Why would someone choose a timeshare over that?
lxp4nkn,"They started waaaaay before air bnbs, my parents fell for it in the 90s. At the time, for a family wanting to vacation in the same spot it sort of made sense, you’d have a whole condo of space and a place to cook instead of eating out every meal (annoying with children)."
lxqqmsj,"My parents bought into West Gate down in Orlando  in the 90s when we were living in NJ when I was a kid because we’d go down there ALL the time. In theory timeshares sound good but holy shit they’re an absolutely terrible idea. It’s like having a second mortgage to go on vacation. They sell you on being locked into a set price forever and you just have to pay the maintenance fees and what have you. 

When I was turning 16, we ended up moving down to Orlando anyways and my parents stopped using it. Sure, they could have used West Gate elsewhere but they weren’t traveling anywhere else at the time. By then this was 2006 and the idea of a timeshare in my opinion has gone by the wayside. 

They ended up selling the timeshare back to them or someone else, I can’t remember. Idk how that part really even works to begin with. 

Anyways, it blows my mind how people still get timeshares and how they’re still in business. I’d rather pay for my hotel/airbnb as I go and not have a stupid timeshare which like I said is like paying for a second mortgage just to have a “free” week or two a year."
lyovz6s,Time shares started in Europe in the 60s. The Swiss IIRC. They came to America in the 70s.
lyq36ux,That’s a nice fun fact
lxp5nyx,"They didn't ""fall for it"" then if it worked for your situation."
lxp69en,"The main thing is you pay a large up front price and then after that you pay annual maintenance fees. So it’s supposed to be like locking in a price for life.  But there can be many, many things that can and do go wrong."
lxp97ch,Yes the main thing that goes wrong is the monthly payments alone add up to more than just renting a random place for 2 weeks a year. It's an all around scam.
lxqtdi3,"It's a scam but back in the day it wasn't trivial to just rent a random place for two weeks. You were likely going to have to get involved with some kind of travel agent for that, so some extra cost on the ""just rent a place"" option. And then you'd have pay them every time you wanted to do a rental. So if you tended to vacation in the same place anyhow there was also some convenience on just dealing with the hassle and much of the cost of finding a place once and then not having to think about it again. 

I wonder what the age spread is on people still doing timeshares. I gotta think it skews pretty heavily old, with people who remember doing it or hearing about it back before the internet existed."
lxr038x,That's a great point. Probably gave a lot of people comfort knowing they didn't have to deal with agents and crap every year and their vacation was locked in. I'm old enough to have needed to print directions through mapquest for road trips. But I still had the internet in general...it just sucked a lot more than it does today. Hard to imagine a time where you just had to figure everything out on your own all the time.
lyoxo80,"My grandparents used to rent a cabin on a lake from the 60s (when timeshares first popped their ugly heads up) They would pay a deposit before leaving the year they were in, to guarantee they would get it for the same weekend the next year. 

My grandmother and her second husband (grandfather and her divorced and then gran and my mom and aunt would go and then she remarried and her new husband would go) ended up buying a spot on the lake when they retired. 

The cabin thing. That lasted like 20 or 25 years. They never had to pay upkeep, never had to pay HOA fees, never had to pay groundskeeping fees. All the bullshit fees timeshares make you pay. And they go up every year. Yeah, every few years the cost of the cabin would go up a bit. But FAR less than all the fees timeshares hit you with yearly. And if they couldnt make it one year, (which happened once due to their divorce) They told the man that owned the cabin. He let my gran and mom and aunt have it a few weeks later and told someone else the weekend had come up available. The guy owned 4 or 5 cabins on the lake. All with docks and came with fishing boats included for your time. (aluminum boat with low end motor, nothing fancy) He also have canoes and rowboats he would loan you for free. 

Sadly, after he died, his kids kept doing this for a decade or so, and then their kids (the old man's grandkids) sold all the property. The places became mostly Air BNBs. All but one. Bought by a nice lesbian couple that was friends with my grandmother until she sold her place at the lake to move to Houston after my step grandfather passed away so she could be closer to my me (so I could go to a better school than the janky assed hick school where my mom lived), my mom, and my aunt."
lxpzy66,"I typically tell people it’s not worth it to start from scratch but having inherited one I reluctantly deal with it. For my yearly maintenance fees (~1800) I can stay at a property that’s much nicer and roomier than if I were to pay out of pocket for an air bnb. The properties however are limited and can be hard to book for the time you want. Also as stated earlier, it’s the up front cost and the sales pitches when ur trying to relax that’s annoying af. More damned if you do than if you don’t at the end of the day imho but not the worst “scam.” At least you’re getting something in return."

lxqecy1,"Fight it.  Don't accept.  There must be a way around that.  No one will make me take my moms.  Good luck with that.  If i had a ton of money, I would prob take it but the maintenance fees are scammy (when you add up all the weeks for each unit and then all the units-that money could maintain the Taj Mahal and realistically some are not maintained nearly as well as they should be, so that's another profit center for them.  Plus the fees for exchanges and RCI.  If you ""owned"" a percent of a home, that would be a true asset that should be somewhat easy to sell.  These are impossible to sell.  Trust me, if they were easy to sell the secondary sales market would boom...but it's more like carrying around an annual bill that has a potential benefit...but most people don't want to keep going to the same place and can't always go at the same time.  Etc. etc."

The reality is that the contractual middle-men extract all the value for themselves while leaving you all the cost and risk (similar to retirement villages, air bnb, uber, delivery apps, etc)."
lxp8sw4,And can't you will it to your family?
lxpct3e,"You can but they are largely considered liabilities and not assets due to their predatory fees and inaccessible usage restrictions. 

Imagine getting willed a Netflix subscription that you could only use to watch movies between 5am and 7am unless you did a bunch of paperwork for each movie. Sure, that may have worked for your retired parents who watch movies in the morning and are made of time to fight paperwork, but it's basically just a monthly fee to get nothing to anyone with a full time office job."
lxqf3ug,"A better example is paying up front for a lifetime of Netflix, that you could only use during a certain few days of the year...but then you still have to pay per month (or year) to maintain the website...and if you decide you'd like to use another streaming site and lend netflix to a family member or friend for your time, they would be charged a large fee for using what you already paid for.  They get you coming, going and a few other ways.  It's legal crime and no doubt protected by a massive lobby or else it would be criminal.  If someone works in Time Share Sales, never talk to them ever, they are worse than a used-car salesmen (some of them might be okay but prob not many)...people that work at the resorts are just reg folks, but the salespeople learn quickly that they are basically scamming...and only a scumbag would stay in that business.  There are lots of shitty people in the world, but I put them up there with people that pray on the elderly.  At 18 when my mom came home from Florida saying she bought one I immediately knew she had been had to some extent...which I was a little older, I would have somehow got her out of it.  It's really hard after 30 years!!!"
lxpdz85,Only if you hate them
lxppac1,"The Last Week Tonight episode noted that many time share contracts you have to reject ""inheriting"" the timeshare contract in order to avoid taking over the liability. Considering many timeshares sell for practically nothing it feels predatory that it is even legal."
lxrfmge,"Yes, because it's technically actually property (it's a share though, not ""real property"" like a house -- more like stock). It's basically worthless property because there's no demand, and it's extremely difficult to find anyone to buy it from you.

It's only useful if you'll actually use the reserved time and location _every single year_, and if the fees are less than you'd spend to stay in that time and place in a hotel/airbnb/whatever. 

Otherwise, whoever inherits it is getting a white elephant they'll have to pay to get out of. Fortunately, you can simply _refuse to accept_ property offered to you, in which case the property is abandoned and not your problem. But talk to an attorney, because you have to actively do things -- you can't just ignore it or say ""I don't want it"", there's paperwork."
lyoy9t5,"Only if you are a complete piece of shit and hate them with all your soul. 

I mean, then you could."
lxpnzxr,"also the cost of your tangible asset is like 10x the value.   that's why they're so many timeshare companies, they're just insanely lucrative.  putting aside the fees for service which aren't negligible they're selling a 1.5 million dollar vacation house for 15 million dollars."
lxph8i3,But what if someone else wants it during your holiday?
lxrpv0q,"They can't use it if it's your turn. You only have access to the timeshare during the time you own, so no one else can use it outside of their time either. This gives them basically no flexibility, so if your vacation this year doesn't line up with your timeshare time, you're shit out of luck and can't go. 

Personally, I'd rather just book a hotel. No long term commitment, I can change location or exact dates every time, there are more services with a hotel than a time share, and I'm not paying for it all the dang time with no refund possibilities if I need to cancel for whatever reason (depending on the specific hotel policy)"
lxsqjp0,"A lot of them use points now instead of weeks, so you buy a certain number of points and the various rooms have a set point cost depending on size and season. Disney and Marriott's both work like this."
lxukdp9,Basically anything to obfuscate the costs and lower the utility over time.
lxuphg0,"The ironic thing is between cash stays and point rentals, non members can game the system and get awesome stays and amenities for dirt cheap comparatively. My family is not MVC members but we have a Marriott condo property we stay at all the time and it's the best kept secret. A 3 bedroom condo and access to the main hotel pool with no resort fees for like $250 a night. We just unplug all the phones on the first night so their sales pitch call doesn't come through 😂"
lxp6hp8,Yep I definitely see that and it’s why it’s such a bizarre concept to me. Thanks for those who took the time to explain it to me!!
lxp4ql5,"Hotels raise their rates in times of high demand. In Plato's ideal of a time share, everyone equally pays for all 52 weeks of the year. In this hypothetical, if they get a timeshare that has 2 weeks during Spring Training available, this person would be saving money."
lxr1onn,"Then it turns out the 52 weeks aren't equal in demand, who would have thought?"
lxpocfv,except they're not paying 1/26th of the price for the two weeks.  more like 1/8
lxrftul,"And the 2 weeks they wanted were the same that 10 other people wanted, but meanwhile all the hottest days of summer are still available."
lxq2n4y,"Oh don't worry, timeshares also increase their rates/fees for high demand times as well."
lxplihy,"Math
Look up their numbers and try it. It NEVER makes sense. People just don't have 4th grade level math. "
lxp6jht,Got it! Yeah I could see that…
lxp6inq,"Because those didn’t used to be things years ago.  Back when timeshares were pretty popular, they were a good concept.  Keep in mind even having a microwave and a fridge in a hotel weren’t even the norm back then.  They were also seen as a status symbol for some.  

The two times I’ve been to one, they were places where a hotel would’ve been way more expensive and/or less convenient.  For example, the one I went to for skiing was in a cabin on the ski property.  Ski gear was already there, so no need to rent most things, we had a kitchen to cook food, didn’t have to worry about parking costs or waiting on others to finish skiing and could go back to the cabin whenever, etc.  For my friend’s family, this is what they did every year around the same time of year, so it was convenient for family vacations 

Part of the problem was getting out of the contract.  They’re hard to sell for one thing.  The fees are expensive, and dates can be limited, so if you can’t get the time off, you eat the costs."
lxq4d2c,Also the fact that 26 people are all vying to go for more or less the same peak season and that most people don't actually want to feel stuck going on holiday to the same place every single year.
lxp4hxk,"It’s the same as a hotel if not better because your not trying to get the days or weeks you want to take off lol 

Timeshare great hunny we are set now! Let’s go away for thanksgiving weekend (you & 100 other occupants say)"
lxpezt2,If you travel like most people with kids it's tough cuz everyone is booking the same time frame.  If your a DINK it makes more sense
lxp4i5k,Fixed vs variable pricing.
lxp4oxh,Because they’re sold as an investment that you can pass down to your heirs.
lxp4wm0,"If they are like my in-laws, then they can claim they are owners and that they own a place in Montana. It’s all about ego and prestige. Nevermind they would save literally thousands of dollars and get to pick the time and place each time if they just did a hotel, that doesn’t sound as cool."
lxpnb2d,"It's always overpaying for some dumpy place in the US too.

You've got one life, with only a week or two of vacation each year, and you want to commit indefinitely to Pigeon Forge or Branson? Wtf?"
lxp6ebg,"Yeah I can see that it would totally be about illusion and “oh we have a vacation home,” clout. Which, yeah, doesn’t really translate for our generations. We can’t afford one house much less vacations houses for 2 weeks? If that’s even owning…"
lxpt5om,"This. I think the illusion of ownership I think is a big factor in people getting time shares. They don't have any meaningful input in the property and they rarely build any meaningful resale value, but for their week a year they can engage in their fantasy."
lxracvf,"Most timeshare plans today allow you to convert time from your base property to other properties around the world. So if you pay for a week of time at a place in Miami you can use that to get a week in Paris for a steep discount. There is a ton of flexibility built into them, really it’s less a timeshare and more a holiday fund you pay into each month to spread the cost over time instead of having to save a lump sum. Still not a good value overall for most people, but you aren’t only stuck with the one place you “bought”."
lxpd415,"It’s technically a real estate transaction, so timeshares are valued because they could potentially be worth more money in the future when you sell it. (As with any real estate investment)

But like any real estate transaction, always always ALWAYS get a real estate attorney before signing ANYTHING"
lxqj7jy,A coworker bought one so he would be forced to take vacation. He was a workaholic and knew he  wouldn't take any time off if he hadn't prepaid.
lxp5faf,Well you also get a stake in it that you can presumably sell which is actually incredibly difficult in practice
lxp64gw,"Like, you own it? I’m sorry I’m sure I sound dense but this is such a weird concept to me. Is it that you’re guaranteed to have a place in the location you want at the time you want to be there as a price you pay over the year instead of all at one time? Otherwise I see no benefit to a timeshare over a hotel. 🤷🏽‍♀️"
lxp6w74,You own a part of it yes. So it's like a bunch of people going in on a house together and having a schedule of who can visit when
lxpalqd,"Not any more. That was when timeshares first started. In the old days, you actually got a share of the property. Deeded real estate. Now they just sell points which equate to time. So x number of points might be a week or two stay somewhere. Problem is, they sell more points than time is available. This means it's near impossible to get the  week you want because everybody else wants that same week. If they want more money, they just sell more points even though there is no more time."
lxp967n,"There is no benefit, except for having a vague sense of ownership. It typically means you end up locked in going to the same place every year (and it’s extremely difficult to sell off your portion of a timeshare if you want to get rid of it). You have a lot more flexibility just renting a hotel room for vacation each year."
lxpluz2,"I mean, you can technically sell a piece of turd, and it's a wayyy better investment than a timeshare, but it's hard to find another dumbass who hasn't graduated from 4th grade and can't do basic math. That's why people can't sell it. It's a vety stupid ""investment"" (it's NOT an investment)."
lxp9egg,"The idea is that because you have bought a share of ownership, you can then vacation there for free every year at your appointed time, saving you the money you would spend on a hotel.

What they gloss over is the fees associated with ownership that basically cancels out this benefit."
lxpbrza,Because 20 years ago you could have a nicer place than a hotel room and pay less money.
lxpii5l,Timeshares never made much sense but they made slightly more sense before airbnb existed
lxpl446,"Yes. But very stupid people who can't think it or do math will fall for it. And in a country where education is as bad as it is in the US, lota of people will fall for it. It's absurd how stupid it is. "
lxpnjt6,"This. In most cases a timeshare isn't cheaper than a comparable hotel or Airbnb, but it's even less flexibility. That's even before the maintenance fees often grow faster than most other things so the value often only gets worse."
lxq1zzr,It's basically a contractually obligatory hotel stay. It's just odd to me.
lxqe9df,"No no no, a timeshare is the same damn spot every time you go. Instead of having flexibility, you lock yourself into one space. It's worse than a hotel."
lxqowgh,It's more like you and a bunch of friends buy a vacation home and split the costs while also dividing up the year so you never use it at the same time.  Except with extra fees and hoops because a 3rd party gets involved to write the contract and the other people aren't actually your friends but randos the 3rd party found for the purposes of making the sale.
lxp6tf3,"my parents had one but you can also change locations of your timeshare. so my parents bought timeshare in aruba (don’t ask me why lol) 

but every 2 years when it was time to use it we would change the location to disney. there’s a price to it but it was still cheaper than going straight through disney. although i don’t think it makes much sense now"
lxp7q6f,"A timeshare includes a deed, which means you own a tiny piece of it (if you buy 2 weeks you essentially own 1/26th of the timeshare property)."
lxpbrl1,"It doesn't make any sense to me. I understand it, and people are talking about benefits here when responding to you, but...

My mom and her hubs bought a timeshare... got it for 4 weeks out of the year so it worked for them. They'd head down to Florida for Spring Break and for 2 weeks in winter. 

The issue... even though it was paid off, they were still paying 800 bucks a month (for maintenance costs and other fees). When they told me that, I immediately said, ""WTF? You only get it for 4 weeks a year.""

They only kept it for 2 years and then sold it. They find a different place to stay every time they go down now."
lxqq7dq,It never made sense to me
lxresmd,"It's not just a room like a hotel -- it's at minimum an apartment/condo. And you actually own a share in it, you aren't just renting (this is a two-edged sword as it also makes it really annoying to get out of); which means it's the _same exact place_ each time, not a randomly-assigned room. You pick out one where you like the view/location/etc. and buy a share in it.

Classically, you owned a _specific period of time_, often a month or more; so like if you bought a share in a condo in Las Vegas for the month of February, that place is guaranteed for that time. The providers offer a path to trading your time and place with other customers (and how this is handled is usually where the scammy parts take root), but the basic idea was you had your reserved weeks with predictability at a much lower and more predictable cost than a hotel."
lxrizda,"Timeshares predate airbnb, and not every place has a hotel or has available booking and some people like to ""feel in charge"" i guess?"
lxswd32,"Well, the main difference (ideally) would be you own it. The property gains value, so it is a property investment. Theoretically in 20 years when you sell it will have matured in value, or you keep it and will only owe your share of property tax, compared to money lost paid to a hotel for 20 years.

This is where the scam really traps people. Contracts stipulate who to sell to and then they make it so you can never actually sell it in accordance with the contract. Also that you'll never really own it. So you get stuck making payments to it, repair costs, etc. Or it is prohibitively expensive to terminate the contract.

So yeah, the issue generally isn't with the concept of sharing property with others, its that you get screwed by the contract details"
lxx0gk4,"People fell for it because it was pitched as an investment, something you ""own"" when it's basically just a vacay rental that's near impossible to get out of"
lxpaytu,"Not really unless your timeshare is shit and available. Which many are.. i have one in Mexico. The resort is super nice. The food is awesome. The problem? We can usually only go with other friends and families that also own one because it's so expensive booking Your your own...  does it make sense of you only go once every 3 years? Nope... 
Do i get a 2 bedroom villa with hot tub on a cliff when I take my family? Yup! Do we have a great time and golf on one of the nicest courses in the world for like $80? Yup.  

Basically,  if I didn't own it and wanted to go here and pay full pop... the time share price would be around trip 4.  We've been going for 13 now. 

Just buy it on the 2ndary market... for half what people pay at the resorts presentations.."
lxpva0m,"Theirs usually more to it. They usually add some sort of rewards program to it. So if you're not interested in renting the property, you get reward points. You can use those points towards travel to other locations. The points reset every year and you redeem them for more travel.

They try to use a perk like this to reel you in. Cancelling the membership is near impossible."
lxp3wl7,I still don’t get it. Couldn’t you also go to a hotel in that same area every year?
lxp5x5s,"The general idea is that you own the timeshare (or at least a portion of it), like owning a house versus renting it. If you spend $X every year renting a hotel room, at the end you have nothing. If you buy a timeshare, though, then you get to use it every year without additional costs and can potentially resell it down the line and make your money back. 

In theory, at least. In reality timeshares have so many fees associated with them that in most cases you're still paying as much every year as if you rented a hotel, and good luck ever selling it."
lxp8dag,"We have one that was ""gifted "" to us by my in-laws.  In reality,  it was just easier to give it to us then it was for them to unload it some other way.

That ""gift"" costs 1k per year in maintenance fees. It's only half an hour from where we live and we've used it once in 18 years."
lxp9fm3,"There are services you can pay to help cancel your timeshare. They charge like a years worth of fees, but they'll unshackle you."
lxpf1sf,Those services are a scam too
lxpi4qb,"Not really a scam. They take a cut, but you're paying for their time. You could do it all yourself, but most of the time, you don't have the time or expertise."
lxpwzgs,Just deed the timeshare back to the company for .01 and walk away. Required no contract knowledge or time.
lxpx3hg,"I do not own a timeshare nor have I tried an exit company, but based on posts on Reddit and [this John Oliver segment](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd2bbHoVQSM&t=1020s&pp=2AH8B5ACAQ%3D%3D), from what I understand many (if not all) of these exit companies take your money and then ride off into the sunset, without ever getting you out of your timeshare contract"
lxq4hc3,Surely theres a service for that too then?
lxt2yrv,It's services all the way down.
lxpx9y9,"In that case, it would just be a scam."
lxpxcdm,..yes
lxq2xr9,"Used to work in a building that had a company doing that, they knew exactly how the original timeshare contracts were made...because the owner of the ""help get out of this scam"" company was the one that sold them the timeshares in the first place, 20 years previously...and they also can't get you out of those contracts, they are just selling them on to other suckers (technically the get you out of the contract, but they are not getting it cancelled), making profit on that then charging you a crazy fee that you are happy to pay to get rid of it. You are literally paying the guy that scammed you to scam you and another person again."
lxpku7v,You accepted it
lxr0m1k,"Well, yes, we accepted it.  We had no idea what owning a condo entailed. We also didn't think (at that time) that it was something we could decline."
lxp4ak8,"Shit happens.  Maybe a convention happens one year, or your favorite team is a World Series contender so prices go through the roof, etc."
lxp618c,Fixed pricing + you have a condo style home vs a hotel room. It was a big sale for families who wanted separate bedrooms + full kitchen. Before air bnb & the only other real way to get this was via a luxury suite which can get costly for families/generally for all of us.
lxpf4q5,"You don’t get it because you have sense.   But they sell a “dream” to people who don’t do numbers well.  

Like this: You DESERVE a vacation don’t you?   You work hard, but you do t go?   Why it’s a hassle it costs money, but if you had a place all ready for you, if your weeks were set, if you invested in yourself - your well being - your rest and recovery you would vacation right!   You need to it’s a stressful world.  Lion how wonderful, you can stay in this million dollar room, and only at a fraction of the cost because you share it!    

Now sign here and set yourself up for the rejuvenation you deserve.  

Taxes, fees, hospitality, food all extra in the fine print.

When we went to a presentation it was like $2500 a year and my wife was like that’s amazing for a 2 week vacation!   And then I did the numbers I. The fees, flight, park tickets, and I was like babe, that’s like $15000 at a time, we can’t do 2 week $15000 every year, we wouldn’t afford the travel and theme parks, so now our $6000 room is wasted.   If we think we can afford $6000 a year, we can just book that when we want and it’s not contractually obligated if we don’t use it."
lxp64pp,"My in laws have had a time share in Lake Tahoe for 20 years. They paid a price for it back then and now only have to pay a few grand a year for two weeks. They go over Xmas/new years to go skiing. If you wanted to get a hotel you’d pay 500 a night. They have the same room, for the same price, every year. They love it. It’s not for everyone. But they definitely got their moneys worth. They can pass it down to my wife or her brother when they pass."
lxp7t3o,"You would own those 2 weeks once it’s paid for.  For X# years you would pay (I think) about what you would pay for a vacation  anyway. Then every year for the rest of your life, your kids’ life, your grandkids lives, those 2 weeks in Disneyland, Cancun, or wherever, are paid for, you just have to get there. 

That was the sales pitch anyway."
lxp97is,"Yes, you can.

Timeshares are a great idea, but terrible in reality."
lxpdbsd,Not if you want the same exact spot every year. You're kinda paying for the ease of use too with a timeshare. If you have the money to spare and you like the exact spot of a timeshare and its amenities then it's worth it. If you are looking at it like a money saver or cheap vacation then it's not worth it
lxp88y8,"Hotel is generally a tiny room with 2 beds.  Timeshare is usually resort styles facility with many amenities and you are staying  in a condo style multi bedrooms suite with a full living room, kitchen laundry.  If you are a family of 4 taking 2 kids to Disney world.  The latter is more preferred"
lxp8ifx,"Hotels don’t usually have full kitchens and large refrigerators, so the theory is you saving money by not eating out 3 meals a day. Also, timeshares are typically much larger than a hotel. Plus you have a washer and dryer, so you can pack less by doing laundry. My dad has several, and they are usually 2 or 3 bedrooms, about twice as large as most hotel rooms."
lxpdlkf,"Once you buy in, the timeshare cost is controlled. Mine was contractually limited to increasing annual maintenance fees to no more than the CPI.
Hotel prices increase every year per market forces, making the timeshare far more economical over time. After 20 years of ownership I was paying $1,200 maint fee for my timeshare while the cost of a room at the associated hotel had increased to more than $3,000 per week."
lxq1ogn,Not physically
lxp9ibe,"You still own the timeshare after you use it. Think of it as a ""regrowing"" asset.

You get say 2 weeks a year to use. In theory, you could use it for a couple years, and then sell it.

You dont have to purchase it over and over again like you would a hotel."
lxp7op6,"My wife's grandpa actually got a time share on lake okoboji here in Iowa. I think he started it back in the 80 or early 90s. 

He paid 300$ for the week in this condo. They told him it's his for this week as long as he pays for in a year in advanced. 

Well he always did for his kids and grandkids. Well we still have it and the price hasn't gone up at all. Its still 300$ for this week while other are paying 2k. 

Idk how he got it in writing that the price would not go up. But it hasn't lol"
lxq06rz,They get him in the yearly increasing maintenance fees probably.
lxq0t7l,We do pay a maintenance fee but so does everyone else. I think with maintenance fees for the whole week likes like 800$ but that's still pretty good considering.
lxq9d3v,"The contracts usually stipulate thr price at signing for the share, but the maintenance fee has to be adjustable.  Costs of maintenance and taxes and staff have to be paid.

They hope there will be turnover every few years to jack up the prices on resold units.

But that's a good deal for a week away."
lxr4w34,"Yeah i asked my MIL how that worked and she did say the maintenance fee has gone up over the years. But it's the same for everyone. 

The two neighbors that go to the other time shares the same week we do. Say theirs is the same as ours. They just pay way more for the room."
lxqg18i,"Any sane person would immediately notice that everyone would like to use them during the same vacation season, and it could never work out to a simple ""365 / # of participants"".

So you pay for the rent during you stay, and also the upkeep while it's sitting empty and losing money."
lxplo8h,"This is what's so sad. The concept is brilliant.

It just never works out that way."
lxpnojf,"My parents had a timeshare that they made good use of. Every other year, like clockwork, they went to Vegas for a week and stayed in their timeshare. They saved some money but could only ever vacation in Vegas, but that was fine for them.

Unfortunately, they were in town during the shooting (fortunately nowhere near it) and never got the nerve to go back.

*Somehow*, the company was decent and let them return their timeshare without a penalty.

So, the theory does work for certain circumstances, but as you say, the scummy companies pretty much ruin it."
lxpahgl,I heard a podcast where they went into it and it turns out that half the people actually really do like them but those companies aren't the same companies pushing people to buy because they really don't need to. Supposedly there are subreddits where they can tell you the good companies and the bad ones
lxq7mlq,"I like the view of how you would do a timeshare if you had friends.

Say that a friend comes to you with a really cool idea: you should get a beach house in a nice little beach-town in Mexico. They've done the math and all the calculations. The house would be low maintenance and be cheap to mantain, the community is one you and your friends know and like and are liked in, and the idea is to keep the impact low while still visiting this place. And it'd be large enough that you, your friend, and your larger shared group of friends could stay and each have their room, even an extra couple if needed. The problem is that due to material constructions, challenges, etc. building this place will cost a whopping $600,000 once you've factored in all the payments, construction costs, taxes, and ultimately some projects you both agree would be great for the community and is the minimum you should do to be responsible. It really is a great deal, your dream beach home, with no moral compromise to get it, at a surprisingly low price (a house like this normally goes for a couple million).

But neither of you could pay that much, no matter how good of a deal it is you just can't afford it. You could get a loan, but you'd need at least $400,000 to make it worth your time, and you just can't justify putting that much for a beach house, even if it'd be an awesome one.

But this is why your friend came with you: he thinks that, if you, and 6 other friends put money It's not a small amount, like 20k plus a monthly $100 per person monthly to pay for the loan plus extra costs, but you could afford it. And you'd have an awesome beach house where you guys could get together. Moreover your friend did the math and if you airbnb the house, you can easily make enough money over the year to pay for the costs, which means that after the $20k, you wouldn't have to pay anything unless some major issue happened, and even then insurance should cover most of that.

To leave finances clear and avaiable you all create a company, you all are equal share holders as you all put in equal amounts of money. You also commit to splitting any expenses needed in the future that can't be covered by renting it out. Rather than using airbnb, you guys get a company to rent it out. You give yourself the ability to rent out a room for free at least for 1 month a year (there's enough rooms) and agree that more than that will be paid, as you guys want the airbnb to cover costs, and that needs you letting people rent it out. During low season you all go and hang out there, and during high season you put some rules to ensure that you don't all rent the house fully, the rooms you rent out during this time make the most money to sustain the business later.

Moreover once the home is fully paid, it'll be even easier to keep the whole thing afloat. And if you ever regret it or are done, you can sell your shares of the company, with the benefits it gives, to someone else. Or when you die your kid can inherit that share of the beach-home. So it's not just for life, it's *forever*.

You've got the barebones of a time-share.

Now imagine that you don't have enough money to pony up $20,000 just like that. So instead you think: what if I went for something smaller? That way the initial cost could be as low as $2,000, way more manageable. But this time there wouldn't have enough rooms for everyone. But you use the same rules as before during high season to just make sure that the room doesn't fill up. Now this means that renting it out is not as easy now, because it gets filled up easily. But that's fine because the monthly costs are now way lower, like $20 once you factor everything in. So it's very manageable, like a Netflix guarantee.

A sweet deal still."
lxq7mzb,"Then I see all of this and realize: hey I could make a business organizing this for other people! I take a small fee, and manage the whole thing, using my experience from before. Not only that, I can get complete strangers and manage all the details myself, way simpler and more direct. So I set the business.



But two problems happen.



The first one is that now I am making a business. See the venture before didn't make money, it just sustained itself, and sometimes would cost something, sometimes very little. But it was fine because what we got was valuable, but now I have to somehow increase those costs to make it worth my fee. But hey, saving the hassle and dealing with that should be worth on its own right?



But then the second problem happens. See most everday people don't understand what a good deal is. They simply assume that whatever they see could be cheaper, but never think through on what compromises and realities are needed.



I remember one roomate I had, when we moved in the old tennats sold me their fully furnished living room, with a massive TV, and the furniture for their bedroom furnishings that included the bed (sans mattress) all already in the home, for just $600. I saw what the furniture was, the TV, the large sectional sofa, the bed was good quality. I did the math and the TV alone would have costed me at least $400 used, and I'd have to move it myself, add the couch and suddenly I was looking at easily $1000. I also realized that the owners were tired to hastling with sellers and just wanted to get rid of it. My roomate wanted to play coy and not take it, the ex-tennats responded by arranging for the furniture to be given out for free on craigslist, I counter-offered to take it at the arranged price because it was a good deal. My roomate scoffed. When I moved out I offered to sell him the living room for $550, I'd keep my bedroom so that was the $50. He didn't like it and said he'd offer me no more than $200 because it was used, I simply responded it was used when I bought it. So I put it in craigslist, the whole thing for $1900 (the TV was the cheapest at $200 but it was old at this point), and I started selling everything. My roomate realized how expensive the couch was. He was shocked when I told him it was going to be at least $900. I had a verbal agreement on the couch for $600, and there was a price to make me go back on my word. He was pissed, but he ended up taking it. That guy was a prick and a bit of a Karen, and honestly I felt a little joy in seeing him realize what a ""clever haggler"" he was.



Point is, in my business I'm dealing with a lot of people like this. People who want to game the system. People who think they can be smarter. People who believe the world is dog-eat-dog and if they aren't fucking someone over, then it \*must\* mean that they're getting fucked (and when this attitude leads to them getting fucked over again and again, they just blame others and double down on the wrong lessons) you know people who needed more hugs when they were kids, and shouldn't have been ferberized. Alas that is life.



So the only way I can make it work is to put all sorts of extreme rules to prevent abuse. Those things that made sense decided among friends? Are now impositions by my company. And in order to make it work with people who are being assholes, and people who are trying to pull lawsuits that are absurd, I have to work with razor thin margins. Which means that in order for the business to work I have to sell more, more, more. The end result is that I have to convince people to take the deal even when they shouldn't, I need to make this work with as many people as I can. I can set it up as a pyramid scheme. This is where the line is, I can either let go of my morals and just scam people, or I can leave the business.



Enough of this, and only shady scammers are left."
lxqye4x,"Yeah my parents have one in Orlando Florida, they split it with the other ""half"" of my family and it's nice to get away every other year for a week. We know what we're getting, it's the same two rooms everytime. 

Thankfully the timeshare is actually with the other half of the family and all my parents do is give them half of the yearly fee so we avoid all the bad stuff."
lxsxxwl,"My grandparents had this exact scenario for around 40 years until the got too frail to travel and then passed away. They spent 2 weeks on the beach in Aruba every year and loved it. After they passed, my uncle inherited it, and sometimes it gets gifted to another family member if he isn't able to go."
lxpc5dq,"For those curious, the idea of a timeshare is actually shit.

The amount of money spent on a timeshare is usually the EXACT SAME cost as just traveling on your own accord but with the freedom to go whenever you want and wherever you want.

The risk is you start to “miss” the days allotted to you or you don’t have a good option available and now you have to book “around” your time share.

It’s like $8K a year for fees, no airline included.

Never had a time share. I travel quite a bit AND we opt for nicer places, book about a week out (not ideal for pricing) and we have kids. Go wherever we want and kind of decide on a whim. Also we’ve tacked on random days. Still about $6k/year on hotels or air bnb.

never do timeshares."
lxpdn5m,"Those salespeople are unbelievable. Going to their presentations with a significant other is a wonderful test of whether or not your relationship will work, by the way. 

I went to one with a girlfriend. They broke her within 15 minutes when the manager came in with a sheet of paper and scribbled a bunch of complicated shit about how this is a ""special opportunity"" and she actually pressured me to buy in as a ""commitment to our future"".

F that. So glad I noped out of both that timeshare pitch and that relationship."
lxplceg,I feel even the concept sounds better if you don't think too hard about it. Are you going to want to go to Spring Training every year? Maybe not. Even if you're a big baseball fan maybe you want to go to spring training in Arizona one year. Maybe you check out the World Baseball Classic another year. Sometimes some teams start the year with a series in a warm climate like Puerto Rico. I remember in Last Week Tonight's episode on Timeshares many eventually got bored of the location of the timeshare. I feel like if most people spent enough time thinking about it they probably wouldn't really find it a great idea even before they realized how hard they are to get rid of.
lxr4gyk,"I never understood timeshares. I think, at best, you are prepaying for use of a condo. It seems just as useful to pay a hotel."
lxrcjlc,"I mostly agree, but even if you take away the predatory aspect of it, there’s still the matter of demand not being equal all year round. Almost everyone wants roughly the same time period based on location due to seasonal activities (skiing, warm weather in winter, etc.), so by nature most people will get stuck with a suboptimal timeslot."
lxs2lqs,"I’m currently working on launching this (vacation club) at my project in Phuket.  Thank you for perfecting designing the concept, benefit - and bullshit that comes with it.  This is exactly what I’ve managed to avoid.  Now just getting past that stigma…"
lxs2xjl,But that just sounds like a hotel
lxs528t,I don't understand how it's wonderful though. They cost thousands that you could just use over time to go wherever you want instead.
lxt6f9o,Behold: blackout dates
lyovltf,"Plus... there are 200 other people who have the same plan that you do. And then 20 that have a better plan that cost more. And those 20 get to chose whatever weekend they want Mostly... and you have to take what is left. And then there are 4 or 5 who pay a lot more and have the BEST plan. And they actually get to pick any weekend they want. And they ALWAYS pick the two weeks of spring training. Along with a few air BNB folks who own a few of the top plans. And because of this, you will never get to pick a ""blacked out"" date. And the only time you actually WILL ever get to chose from are right in the middle of the worst time of the year to stay. But they sure sold you on getting to come stay every year for spring training. 
And in the states they are hugely common in... because of lobbying by the corps that own the time share companies... they are almost iron clad contracts and incredibly difficult and costly to get out of. (most of the companies that get you OUT of timeshares... are also owned by the over companies that SELL timeshares) 

And in a lot of those states, yes... your children CAN be forced to pay for them after you die. There are procedures they can go through that will take a hell of a lot of time and probably money... and may not work the first time or two they do them. 


They are horrible for 99% of the people who get them. 

I used to joke that if I didnt like my kids or their spouses, I would get a time share late in life and leave it to them. But then, I thought... what kind of asshole would do that, also, with my luck I would be given a dose of magic medicine that made me live for ever. LOL"
lxp7n6m,I love my timeshare for the reasons you mentioned.
lxp3n1d,"There was time in which if you only ever wanted to vacation in the same place at the same time every year, they may have made sense. One of my former bosses had a timeshare on Hilton Head Island, and he always took off the same week in August to go there and play golf for a week. It probably made sense for him.

This was before all that points trading bullshit they came up with later. So he probably did save money over booking a resort there every year, even with the maintenance fees."
lxptva0,"There were some loopholes back in the day too, I know one of my family members had several in the mid 80's to early 90's that were owned by his corporation and  probably used on one side as a listed asset and a write off at tax time because they were in locations where shareholder meetings took place."
lxpcxdb,"Yep. This is why the disney world timeshares actually make sense for some, plus they are probably easier to sell off eventually too."
lxp4orh,"In theory it is co-owning a vacation property.


2 friends owning a vacation property together? Perfect sense. Neither loses much utility because they only use it 2-10 weeks out of the year so just some minor schedule adjustments and you can save 1/2 the cost,


3 friends? Fine. 5? ok. 10? Scheduling would be a pain. But what if it was 12 and 2 places. Now you save a lot money and can get a decent schedule. 


Now expand that to thousands of people across 100 rooms in a hotel. Not terrible in theory. 



But now it’s gotta be run by a business since you need investors to build the big property and can’t find 100 friends. Well it’s a business so you gotta make the most money, so you sell maximum coverage. Now it is 52 people with 1 week each per room! To buy the property you agree to pay annually for upkeep and management. 

Scheduling now sucks. Lots of black out dates. Make more money charging premiums to over come that. 

You’re a management company now so raise the annual dues to get more money. 

Someone wants to back out now? Too late no one wants to buy into a high fee property with weird black out dates. Can’t get out of the contract.




That’s kinda their inception to bastardized late stage capitalism current existence.


People buy into it still because they just get sold on the idea of a share in a vacation property, which at face value a fine idea."

You can imagine how difficult this can be. It takes ages for a family of 5 to decide what to order for dinner, imagine trying to book 2 weeks in the summer and have 9 ""partners"" agree with the timing of your booking.

By the way feel free to correct me, I am not an expert."
lxpiztl,They can make sense if you always want to go to the same place for vacation.
lxprntz,"My parents got 2 weeks at Vail in a 2 bedroom basement unit. It was $3,000 I think and the maintenance fees each year were about $100-175 a year over the course of my childhood. You could trade it for a week somewhere else for about the same. My wife and I spent a week on Eagle Beach in Aruba for our honeymoon and my parents spent $140 to give us that gift. 

Despite it being not a great unit we got 2 weeks of skiing each year at a world-class resort and we were close enough to walk to the lift in our ski boots. I started skiing when I was 2 and last time I went I was 22, so that's 20 years of skiing plus whatever my parents got before and after then. Now that they are older they just trade both weeks when they travel. It's a bit more, but still cheaper than 7 nights hotel.

I'm sure most deals are crappy, but they don't regret this one one bit."
lxrdx3k,"It's the commercial equivalent of buying a condo with some friends in a cool location -- you own a share of a specific room/condo/apartment/whatever, and you pay your share of the ""HOA fees"" every month/year. When you sign up, you pick the days/weeks each year you want to reserve the place for. If you want to move that around, there's a system to trade your week with others for a small fee. There's also a system where you can trade _places_ with someone who has a share at some other place.

Sketchy business people quickly figured out that if you make the ""trading"" part complex enough while making it sound like a _really good deal_, a lot of people will fall for it and they get to keep all the excess money people spend without using their timeshare.

There are actually a few legitimate ones left, despite the vast majority being a scam. And even the kinda-scammy ones can be ok if you actually just find a place you want to stay for the same week/month/whatever each year and don't plan on using any of the trading/flexibility parts."
lxrikzn,"in theory it makes sense. You want a vacation home. You only use it 2 weeks a year. Why pay for it 52 weeks a year? share it with 26 other people and everyone gets it for 2 weeks.

When you layer in the complexity of everyone wanting to go at the same time, legal liabilities and insurance, and good old fashioned corporate greed it gets more complicated."
lxsoqi2,"I think there's definitely a benefit if you can afford to and have the time to take a week or more vacation every year. If you're already doing that, a timeshare would be a good idea. Especially one like Hilton's with the points based system. 

The whole timeshare idea operates on selling you ""property"" that you can use for a set amount of time. So you buy a week in Florida, 2 weeks in Hawaii, etc for an upfront fee. They tell you that you ""own"" part of that property now, and as an owner you and all the other owners are responsible for paying the maintenance and property taxes every year. Some of these companies even issue a special ""deed"" to show you are an owner. But it's really the company passing all the burdens of being an owner onto you and keeping all the benefits for themselves.

Imagine having a roommate in your house. You tell him since he's living there now, you're going to give him some ownership of the house. So he gives you 20k as a payment, and then starts paying his share of property taxes, insurance, repairs, etc. Then in 10 years you decide you want to move away so you sell the house. Does your roommate get his 20k back? Do you give him part of the profit that you made? Nope. You tell him ""hey I sold the house that surrounds your room, so someone else is going to live with you now, have fun"", and take your money to your new house so you can do the scam all over again with someone else."
lxpazfj,"Like every other thing, something starts out good and the predators get into it and spoil it for everyone. I have owned two timeshares and both were very good because I did the research and only bought with major reputable chains, at places where we go every year anyway, and have divestment clauses for when you want to sell out. What I paid in total was far less than hotel rooms. 
Big rule: never buy from the salesman. Visit the resort, listen to their spiel but be strong and walk away, buy from an individual wanting to sell theirs. You'll save about half the buy in price.

saved me a ton of money over hotel prices."

lxqjdbr,"Maaaaan I narrowly escaped this in Vegas once. After wasting the whole day trying to politely escape the sales pitch, and finally leaving. They go behind my back and get my wife to sign. . . They explained every single document except one, they tried to slyly sneak that one into the pile. 

I pulled it out later and found out we had 3 days to cancel. Shut that shit down quick!"
lxp7muf,I know two people who have 3-4 timeshares each. Needless to say (but here I go) they aren’t very bright and they now resent the properties and don’t even use them. Yet they burn the money away.
lxp9hzm,"""I just wanna go someplace where we know somebody who can plug us into the social pipeline"""
lxp9iaa,"Oh this! The old *""you can't afford NOT to go on vacation!*""  Think John Oliver did a segment on it last year."
lxpbjgh,"John Oliver's bit on timeshares was done so well. It was very funny, but also very informative and showed what a massive scam it is."
lxpdx94,Hilton Grand Vacations is so bad
lxp7od0,These always sounded horrible to me. Never understood them.
lxp8a16,"Just a couple of years ago, someone I know really wanted to get a timeshare. It would have wrecked her financially (she was barely getting by to begin with). It took a LOT of effort for me to get through to her. Some people are desperate to believe that things that sound too good really can be true. (She didn’t get the timeshare, and later thanked me for saving her from it.)"
lxp93zq,Great answer. Mind boggling.
lxpah1q,"I don’t even know what a timeshare is, such an outdated thing lol"
lxpaqhl,"Jesus, my neighbor was talking about this. She LIVES in Florida and has timeshare IN Florida. Why?

She's like, ""you can stay there anytime you want because I never go. Well, you do have to pay for the transfer fee. It's only $199. And there's just a few other fees. No more than a few hundred extra. Probably."".

Yeah, no thanks."
lxpd7ap,This is the one I thought of first. It's such a well known scam it's basically a punchline at this point. How is there still anyone remaining to still be fooled?
lxpdxdj,Bruh the stories I’ve heard from my lady who works as a senior closer for a timeshare company….
lxpf9ja,"Man, a few years ago John Oliver did an episode on time shares and I did not realize how bad it was. When you buy one your kids, grand kids, great grand kids and so on will have to deal with it. 

Then there's a whole nother scam that claims to help you get out of timeshares....it's a real scummy business."
lxpl8nl,"On a family vacation in the UK in the 80s we went along to a presentation at an old manor house that was being converted into Timeshare units. We got a guided tour of the historic manor, got to look at all the facilities, had a decent buffet lunch, and then at the end when they pulled out the paperwork my parents said ""Sorry, we're from Australia so we'd never use it"" and we walked out like absolute savages."
lxpuvsz,"I did one of those bc they offered a $200 gift card to a fancy restaurant in the area and it was 'only an hour'. It in fact was like 3 hours. The salesman dragged out the tour of the property. Then, the manager comes to talk numbers. That didn't work so the manager went to get 'the closer'. The whole process was to wear me down to buy something. They legit went from $1000 to $150/yr while adding a bunch of perks to their membership program. After many NOs from me, they finally gave in and gave me the gift card. 

The meal was nice and it being free was awesome, but the whole process was like dragging me through sand."
lxq0qbm,"Yes. We had an elderly relative who was in a timeshare but passed away. She used to take us on holiday on these timeshares because there were multiple resorts you could choose. So we already had some booked in before she died. The timeshare company were actively trying to make the next of kin pay for the continuation and upkeep of it. We asked about the ones that were already booked that were essentially paid for but to use them we would have to agree to another 50 years of payments or something. They weren't concerned that their customer had died, just concerned with who they were going to continue fleecing."
lxq8l3r,"Always a ripoff if you buy them directly, because they use markup on the direct sales to recoup the costs they incur in promotion/sales.

  
Always a ripoff if you just ain't going to use them, and you would never recoup the costs trying to sell it.

That being said, I have a few friends and family who have had them paid off for years and use them every year who have no complaints. And, when they have excess, they offer it up to friends and family to use."
lxqjx7s,"We got suckered into timeshares 2 years ago. First they draw you in by pretending you've won a free holiday, then they sit you down and tell you how your dream of vacationing overseas (something we can never afford to do) is within reach for a small payment every month.

I phoned and cancelled the next morning once I'd come to my senses, but man, their sales people are just so good."
lxqmm4t,"I know two people who have a good, working timeshare. One is a cabin near a ski resort, once is a city spa.

Both have fixed one week times to use the place per year, and the only costs are the annual dues that cost less than the hotel/cabin would cost without the timeshare.

They are owned by people that live their lives with a very steady routine, so they will, without fail, use their vacation days on said weeks.

And these are the kind of people who, this specific type of timeshare, is worth it. To nearly 99.9999999% of the rest of humanity, THEY ARE NOT WORTH IT."
lxqpq5j,"I remember a friend of mine years ago who just got married and they didn't have enough money to afford a car, but they were so proud that they got a Time Share in Colorado.  It was only $75 per month and they could use it for three days a year, during the month of March, and only on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.  They had that contract for three years, never used it, and when they tried to stop it they found out they were locked into a five year commitment."
lxqshwf,"First time I went to Vegas, right after we check in to the hotel and get ready to hit the strip my friend starts taking to this guy in the hotel lobby trying to sell him a time share. 

My friend is just standing there hearing this dude out for fifteen minutes before I'm finally like ""Paul, let's get out of here. You don't want to buy a timeshare"""
lxqyqg2,People paying thousands of dollars to get rid of their timeshare. We just donated ours to charity and got a tax write-off.
lxr1cdx,Getting OUT of them too. Just as much a scam as buying one in the first place. John Oliver did a whole bit on it.
lxr90rs,"Hey, I have a timeshare, lol. They’ve changed since the days my parents have to go to some presentation in the middle of a vacation.

At least mine is different, anyway. I get points instead of time, and it’s an inheritable asset in a tourist spot. Not some random in-land Florida timeshare far away from anything touristy."
lxrins8,"Honestly one of the less moronic things to fall for

I get the concept... You could even make a version that isn't a scam if you wanted. It's just run by slimeballs"
lxrmgpd,"but I love to take their free or cheap stuff.  For years it was the only way I could afford to vacation. Just last year my daughter & I went to Cabo for a getaway and got lured into timeshare offer with food, drink and golf at a very exclusive, private resort.  Heck yeah!!  Spent an hour touring properties, an hour saying no and off to amazing day. Wasn't planned and turned into the highlight of our trip."
lxrn4rj,My parents have one and it's crazy how impossible they are to get rid of. Its the one inheritance you can give to ruin someone's life.
lxrp5lw,"I went to a presentation once because they were promising a $500 gift card either if you bought one or didn’t buy one. I was in dire need of a set of new tires. 

I survived although the pressure was brutal. The attractive sales lady smoked like a chimney and her car smelled like a 70’s NYC dive bar. 

I got my $500 gift card. I’ve even signed up for more but for some reason they don’t call me."
lxs0df2,"Time shares are really only scams if you go in with strangers . But lowkey if you did a time share with people you know well, it’s actually worth it … too bad they’re way too costly due entirely to the salespeople"
lxs3p4s,"My wife and I bought into a timeshare company and… we like it. We bought the smallest package they were offering and refuse to spend any more money with them (oh, they try), but for what we use it for it’s perfect."
lxs8jh1,"Oh, god....I worked with a woman who was in her early 60s that got talked into buying one at a resort hotel that's only a couple of miles from her house. She and her sister lived together and each put up 20K to get free weekend hotel rooms every week for the rest of their lives, as long as the hotel isn't sold out that weekend. It's in Phoenix, so of course it's sold out every weekend throughout the fall and winter when then temperature drops and the snowbirds are in town. 

Sorry, Wanda, you're a sweetheart and make great cookies and all, but you're an idiot."
lxsll6x,This REALLY depends on your situation. My wife and I have had ours for years and use it all the time. I wouldn’t consider any besides Hilton or Marriott but we take four or five vacations a year and it’s a great deal for us.
lxsuynx,"They weren't, once upon a time. My grandparents have had a timeshare in Hawaii since the early 90s and it's been huge for them.

But these days they seem to be absolutely *awful*."
lxt35wd,"I have an aunt who is one of the microscopic few who actually turns a profit on timeshares.

She has one specific resort that she loves, and she knows it's popular with particular international communities who don't want to buy in permanently. She has enough consecutive weeks between two units that she spends 3-5 months there in the winter and only changes units once. Otherwise she has anywhere from 3-6 other units available for rent at any given time. Her expense is the maintenance fee, and she just adds that to the price for the renter. Usual rent is $3k-$5k for the week depending on how close to Christmas/New Year's it is. Maintenance is like $600 per unit per week. It's become her own little fiefdom.

When some folks sell, they do everything they can to *not* sell to her. She finds ways to buy them anyway. Other folks will think she's knowledgeable about the property and they'll ask her to list it for them. Which she will deliberately do badly so no offers come in, and then she can make a lowball of her own."
lxttq9p,"Oh my God! I have a sister-in-law who has multiple timeshares! She's always trying to rent them or trade them. It's absolutely wild! At least one of the companies has told her if she doesn't pay her unit off her ""heirs"" will be responsible for the debt to try to get her to pay more than whatever she already is paying monthly."
lxvf0df,"Husband and I will go to a timeshare thing every once in a while so we can walk away with the 4 day cruise. Never bought anything, get a heavily discounted trip. It's worth it to listen to them yammer away for a couple hours."
lxvk49v,My brother owns nit one but two. So he can pass them down to his two sons. 🤦🏻‍♀️
lym2tdn,"I love the timeshare game. Go to their presentation and sit through them lying. You get free hotel rooms. It's normally the really nice suites too. If you can keep saying ""no"" you should try it."
lxq6gi5,These *can* be rockin' deals on the second-hand market. I'm close friends with somebody who bought one second-hand in 2021 for $5000. She now has two weeks in Cancun for *$800 CAD / year.*
lxpju02,"That's because not all timeshares are a scam.

I have a week at the base of a popular ski lodge in Colorado, 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, full kitchen - I pay $930 for the week, including maintenance fees. If I were to try to rent an equivalent place, I may end up paying $700 a night.

I also have a week on an island off the coast of Florida, it's $860 for the week, including maintenance fees. This one is a 2 bed, 2 bath, full kitchen, waterfront and includes dock space for the boat. I'd pay $700 for the dock space for the week alone. 

Some timeshares are scams, some are not. I can either use them myself, or rent them for $3,500 to $5,000 a week each - that's below market, because the owners typically rent to each other as a courtesy. If I rent to a random person, I could easily rent for more.

My family has owned both since the early 80's, so we're well into the time frame when they promise that being an owner will pay off.

Neither were part of large corporations when they were built, and still aren't today. They're privately owned, and managed, by a collective of the owners."
lxsqke6,"You’ve had good experiences because like you said, they are small and privately operated. I know people who bought into similar timeshares and actually really enjoy them. That was the original purpose of them.

The problem is the big corporations and hotel chains who operate time shares know how to suck the money out of people. Those are the bad ones."
lxwaf0d,"Exactly my point.

It's not timeshares that are a scam, it's big businesses tricking people. There is nothing inherently scammy about a timeshare - it all comes down to the contract, and not being a moron."
lxx92am,The problem is there aren’t very many like yours anymore. The vast majority are the big corporations with high pressure sales who are looking to squeeze out every dollar they can.

lxrhh59,"Sorry, was giving background on the people. Logan Paul literally has a crypto scam in Cryptozoo and Mr Beast doesnt pay his philanthropy bills."
lxq2vr4,"It's not a scam now, but they have said their goal is to sell directly to schools. So they're effectively using kids as their middleman to hype up demand for schools to commit to long-term contracts at high prices for shitty product (what they're selling for now is not what a nationwide rollout of daily school lunches would cost). 

Also there's been a ton of reports of mouldy product."
lxpav8m,"The way I see it is that it’s a scam because by the numbers, yes, Lunchly is “healthier” than a lunchable by a negligible amount, but costs at least $1.00 more. 

Both are not healthy lunch options, but Lunchly has the influencer name branding to sell to an impressionable audience and charge more as a result."
lxp6sz2,"It's not a scam. People on this website just label everything they don't like as a scam.

That being said, Lunchly is still an extremely shitty product"

he also got paid. sources vary and the actual contract is confidential, but somewhere between 20-40 million

he had a lot of money at one point in time but he's gone through almost of all of it. the reason he agreed to take the fight is because he's already proved everything he had to prove, he thought it would be fun to get in the ring again, and the purse was fucking colossal"

I used to be close friends with their kids but the husband kept calling and trying to push my dad into buying more and selling more Amway stuff to the point where it was causing a strain in my parents marriage."
lxsfs7d,"I'm related to someone in the very top levels. I've seen them at their job, which used to be traveling around the world telling people how rich Amway had made them. I haven't talked to them in decades, but they are still EXTREMELY rich and have made multi-generational wealth with it. They have so many people underneath them making a bunch of money that they'll never have to worry about it again. Three generations are taken care of so far, none of them will ever have to work. 

I watched them buy a house for $760k in cash when that was still a lot of money. They gave it away as a gift. 

It may not be possible to get rich now, but there damn sure are a lot of people that have already done so."
lxtcu9g,"All the money gets funnelled to the top so unless you are at the top, you won't make much off it while spending so much time in it"
lxtjthf,Yeah that's for sure. Back in the 90s they were making $6 million a year minimum from the people under them. They didn't sell anything as far as I remember.  They literally traveled the world telling people how rich they were and that if they just signed up and worked hard they could be where they were at before too long. I don't know how they live with themselves. They're some of the most disgusting people I've ever met. They're still rich as fuck too. It's so wild

lxqd8io,That's what turned my mom off him. She was really great with him and read his books and then the moment he needed to practice what he preached she saw him for who he was.
lxqprir,He finally relented after being called out on social media. Fucker lied about flooding in his church.. ppl who lived nearby went and showed that it wasn't. It was the lower portions of the parking garage. (He didn't want the  poors in his church)
lxsz28k,"I didn’t know this, but it also doesn’t surprise me. He’s garbage."
lxqrf4r,"Having worked several Tornados, I will say that he did the right thing.  During the 2013 Tornadoes that hit Oklahoma we had about fifty people in our church building.  In the span of an hour we had several doors kicked in so they could see what was behind locked doors, we had several inside windows smashed, some people let their dogs dump in the auditorium, and a lot of general destruction.  Then a few of them came back a week later and tried to sue us for some petty reasons.  People are horrible in these situations"
lxrjom3,"As someone who has been ordained and helped run a church, and also worked through several natural disasters, I beg to differ. Yes, some people suck. But Christ calls His followers to help _anyway_, and the idea that you'd have the ability to help people in need but refuse to do so because some might take advantage is _incredibly un-Christlike_.

A Christian making this decision for their privately-owned hotel would deserve some side-eye; someone claiming to be a teacher of the Word of God deciding not to help because some people are shitty -- and then lying about it -- deserves shunning."
lxs3i2d,">and the idea that you'd have the ability to help people in need but refuse to do so because some might take advantage is incredibly un-Christlike.

No one said that we did not help, however there is a difference between what one can do to help and what someone else thinks they should do to help."
lxtivm6,Joel Osteen didn't help. That was the subject. And he definitely could have opened his church -- as evidenced by the fact that he eventually did once he got enough bad PR and got caught lying.

Yes they are.

Yeah, that's also true.  Did Jesus die less for them?  Maybe he didn't die for them at all, and would have said ""ew, get away! You'll probably shit on my altar.  That thing is ornate, just how I like 'em."" Right?

>People like that shit on the street all the time,

Where would you have them do it, their own private bathroom?

> I have no idea why you think it can't happen in a Church.

It definitely could happen in a church. According to you, you heard a story about a time it did. I don't know why that's your default assumption about homeless people.  If you were homeless, and you were invited in, would your first move be to shit on the altar and trash the place?  You already know it could happen, right?  So is that what you would do?  Is that why you're stu k on the assumption that anybody would?"
lxu50ty,"Mate I've literally studied homelessness. They aren't just people who lost a job.

Giving homeless people a place to sleep for one night isn't actually helping them when they don't have control of their mind or bodies. And people who do and are homeless can be provided with shelter elsewhere by the Church. Nobody needs to actually live in the building to be helped, at all.

You were pretty quick to talk up the catholics earlier.

As far as me being ""morally superior"", nah.  I'm about two bad days away from shitting on an altar somewhere.  The thing is, Christians will spout off about their inherent moral superiority to the point that it's nauseating.  They worship a guy who they'd vote to deport, because he was a homeless immigrant."

I am also not tax exempt, and am glad that part of what is taken from my paycheck goes to help addicts and the mentally ill.  I wish that part was bigger.

I say religious groups, because some do group meets at various places taking donations ect... during those meetings.

And I know for a fact that he donated well over 50k/year based on what he got from our company. PLUS he owned a lasertag/video game arcade and donated heavily for that too. AND he gave his church members discounts on lockins and playing blocks. It actually cost him this business because another member owned a skating rink with an arcade. ANd they made a huge deal about how lasertag and many of the arcade games were ""violent"" and the church turned away from him over it. After he had been giving them hundreds of thousands over the years. But could he still keep donating. He had to sell the arcade. And yet he kept donating to the church. 

They still meet in the school gym for free every week. And they make a shit ton of money every year. They have about 500 members that are regulars, and many own small businesses like my former business partner. That donate heavily. And they shove conservative politics down your throat at every service. I went to be polite a few times. And every time they tried to get me to tithe and donate. I was like, nope... I have better things to do with my money.

That has coincided with enormous improvement in almost every area of life - from personal freedom to mental health to just general human decency. It's difficult to overstate how much society went from screwed to unscrewed as the Church declined in influence.

Now, I know correlation is not causation - but in this instance it's really difficult not to draw a direct causal line given that almost every improvement in human dignity during that time was vociferously opposed by the Church. And that's without getting into the weeds with the child abuse, slavery, septic tanks full of dead children, and all the other specific horrors the Church is responsible for.

lxs2bhs,"Just because things appear to be better, doesn’t mean they are. Ireland has one of the worst mental health rates in the EU, and was progressively getting worse even before COVID. 

https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/20f96f89-7286-4e4f-8a2c-bea12cf97576_en?filename=2023_chp_ie_english.pdf

Page 23 onward discusses the mental health issues in Ireland."
lxsbb3v,"Thanks for the link. It's interesting that we have lower levels of depression and suicide than the EU average - anxiety disorders account for the majority of the difference between Ireland and the rest of the EU. And the suicide rate is falling (I wish the data provided went back further than 2005 - the 1990s are when the Church faced its steepest decline, so that's the main decade of interest).

I will say in my case that I've had an anxiety disorder my entire life, but it was only diagnosed in adulthood. And much of mine can be attributed to PTSD from abuse suffered in the 1980s. I'd be surprised if my story was a rare one among people my age and older.

I'm sure this is a story among other countries as well, so I'm not sure how unique this is to Ireland, but there has been a massive increase in recent decades of awareness of mental health issues and their importance.

Also - looking at the ""Key Findings"" section - life expectancy is up, suicide is down (and below EU average), alcohol consumption is slightly down.

It's also worth noting the financial disaster that was 2008, and the global disaster that was 2020. Ireland is far from the only country to be hit hard by both of those years, and the data reflect that. That's all after the Church lost its grip on society though - as I said earlier, that mostly happened in the 1990s and early 2000s. [This table here](https://wid.world/www-site/uploads/2021/01/WorldInequalityLab_WP2021_01_EuropePolCleavages_Appendix.pdf#page=356) illustrates that nicely - even if it's only in decade-long data points, church attendance falls and ""no religion"" spikes during that time.

TLDR: The data show that Ireland has generally poor mental health, but it's not uniformly increasing and these data don't address the years we're talking about anyway."
lxtx859,"It's correlation. Religious people have statistically better lives according to studies, I see no reason why it would be the reverse in Ireland. 

Not to mention that I believe Church attendance is around 35% there today."
lxtzyim,"There's a difference between individual people being religious and how it affects them personally, and the broader influence of religion on society. In my lifetime in Ireland, homosexuality was decriminalized (1989, opposed by the Church), contraception was made available without prescription (1990, opposed by the Church), divorce was legalized (1995, opposed by the Church), institutional indentured servitude was ended (1996, when the Church closed their last Magdalene Laundry), and more recently gay marriage (2015, opposed by the Church), abortion (2018, opposed by the Church), and blasphemy (2018, amusingly not opposed by the Church) were legalized via referendum. Plus there's the influence of the Church on schooling - their opposition to science-based sex ed, their spreading of lies about contraception, their late abandonment of corporal punishment, their general dedication to keeping people stupid and miserable - sure, maybe individual believers are happier. But their Churches make life worse for everyone. Religious people are very likely happiest if they're a minority, because theocratic societies are absolutely *not* where people thrive."
lxu0oaa,"Yeah none of that actually is real, and this ""religion is evil"" BS is stupid. People voted on policies that they agreed with based on their religion, so the society was fine with that. They weren't harmed by something they literally agreed to at all.

Voting based on your belief is not a theocracy either. None of your ""religion is good as long as it's a minority"" has any statistical proof at all.

This idea that most good things were opposed by the Church is also completely non-factual."
lxu4dby,"Which part of that is not real? You don't think those laws were changed, or you don't think the Church opposed those changes? You don't think the Church kept slaves in Ireland until 1996? It's fairly widely documented. 

You do have a point about the complicity of wider society in the Church's worst misdeeds - it's made of people, after all, and those people didn't materialize out of thin air. The Irish State has paid compensation to some of the victims of the Magdalene Laundries (which the Church still refuses to do). People are not blameless when they do the shitty things the Church tells them to do. But whenever people start bettering themselves and making moral progress, the Church stands athwart that. I'd even argue that the Church has opposed almost every increase in human dignity over the last millennium or thereabouts. It certainly opposed the abolition of slavery until after the last major Catholic country had abolished it themselves (Brazil in 1888, followed by the Church in 1890).

But if we can't agree about what's real, there's unlikely to be a fruitful discussion. I assume if you're religious we disagree about lots of ways the universe works - but the history I outlined above isn't an article of faith, it's legal history that happened in the last 40 years.

In any case - I've seen with my own eyes how much better Irish society is now that the Church has lost its power. Individual people can believe what they like and if it makes them happier that's lovely. But giving a church any voice in policymaking is almost always the worst way to do it."
lxu6kfv,"1. You are stripping out context for everything you say. Letting mentally ill people/criminals work, or letting people admit themselves to these laundry things is not ""slavery"" any more than rehabilitation is slavery.

2. You are mentally ill.

3. Ireland is a country founded on terrorism and car-bombing children. It is not a happy place to live, and that's because your country is terrible. Don't blame Christians for any of that shit.

""I think life has gotten better"" is not proof it has gotten better. And you cannot just say ""you can't vote based on your core religious values"" just because you disagree with those values. That's not democratic at all."
lxua6qm,"Whoo boy! I was all ready with citations to refute your first point (it was forced labour and they were not free to leave), but your third bullet point is *impressively* stupid. It betrays not only total ignorance of the topic at hand, but also pride in that ignorance. Congratulations?"

lxpf2a1,"Sounds interesting, did the author source anything from the scammers themselves?"
lxpifap,"So I Googled it and it appears they do: 

""Yes, scammers intentionally include errors in their emails, including Nigerian scam emails, for several reasons: 

 gullible targets

Scammers want to avoid people who notice mistakes and are less likely to be duped. They send intentionally flawed emails to isolate the most gullible targets. 

Get past spam filters

Scammers may misspell some relevant words to increase their chances of getting past spam filters. 

Make emails seem more authentic

Misspellings and grammatical errors can make emails seem more authentic and believable, especially when impersonating an individual. 

Build rapport

Minor errors can make emails seem more relatable and help scammers build rapport with their targets.""

So there you have it.

Edit: spelling"

lxpnxij,"I'm pretty sure I did but here it is again.... 

While we may not have directly asked a Nigerian scammer about their motivations, the understanding of why scammers use misspellings in their emails is derived from several sources:

1. Patterns in Scamming Techniques

Research and Analysis: Experts in cybersecurity and fraud prevention have studied various scamming techniques, including those used in advance-fee fraud (often associated with Nigerian scams). Their analyses reveal common strategies employed by scammers.

Behavioral Insights: Behavioral economics provides insights into how individuals respond to certain cues, such as misspellings or grammatical errors. This helps explain why scammers might employ such tactics.

2. Scam Email Characteristics

Common Features: Many scam emails share similar characteristics, including poor grammar and spelling. This has been documented in various studies and reports on online fraud.

Targeting Vulnerable Audiences: Scammers often aim to reach individuals who may be less discerning or more likely to overlook red flags, which can include misspellings.

3. Expert Testimonies

Insights from Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Experts: Professionals in these fields have provided insights into the motivations behind scamming tactics based on their investigations and experiences with scams.

4. Victim Reports

Testimonies from Victims: Many victims of scams have reported that they initially overlooked the errors in the emails, indicating that these misspellings can indeed serve as a filter for less discerning individuals.

Conclusion

While we may not have direct statements from scammers themselves, the collective evidence from research, expert analysis, and victim experiences supports the understanding that intentional misspellings are a tactic used to filter potential victims effectively."

lxpuld6,"I use Perplexity which uses about a dozen LLMs, only one of which is GTP-4.  And it does indeed provide references. That's how I chose the business insider article (one of many references provided) which I thought would satisfy the documentation requirement.  Apparently OP (and others) dismiss those who have spent their careers in cyber security or the behavioral sciences.

I have no experience in cyber security or behavioral sciences but I figure the original spelling and grammar errors were just as you suggest: language barrier. But as time has gone by they're just sticking with what works.  I figure they make enough money that they could put an English speaker on the payroll if they felt it would improve their odds.  But they know who, and who they do not, want to target.

If you haven't tried Perplexity I highly recommend it. Seems to be a cut above."

I think the jury is still out.

I was sure she would have been kidnapped and held for ransom as soon as she stepped foot off the plane, but I saw the pictures first hand from her daughter, of her mid 60’s, human embodiment of unbaked pillsbury dough looking mother, in full traditional Nigerian garb, marrying a young 20 something Nigerian man. Saw pictures of her with his family, his/his families home and everything. 

She returned to the U.S. completely unharmed, on cloud nine, head over heels in love. She unfortunately died shortly after, before she was able to bring her husband over here.

Kenneth Copeland didn't get elected president twice... I think there's a one-up."
lxs9ew9,"No but he's right there as his spiritual advisor, and he wasn't running for president. Not enough money in it for him, and he'd actually have to work instead of people just freely handing it over to him without having to pay taxes whatsoever."
lxp0frn,"Friendships with military colonel’s stuck overseas, looking for companionship, which turns into needing money."
lxp1l9m,sounds very specific
lxsdp9w,"Romance scams, and adding in the ""It's a soldier"" part. And an officer! Officers make big buckaroos."
lxqlfxc,"Yes, generally you need to be specific when describing something"
lxryxug,All the women love Colonel Angus.
lxqtog6,Yes. This is their formula. These scammers aren’t artists carefully crafting unique love stories.
lxprhxb,"It's particularly insane when romance scammers pretend to be in the military, on military service. One second of logical thinking, which I realize is inherently missing in these exchanges, would tell you that no one in the military *on active service* is ""trapped"" overseas or ""unable to access their records/veteran's benefits/etc."" without paying huge sums of money. The military gets a lot of flak, and rightly, but they transport people (or pay for the expenses thereof) people in active duty. They feed them. They house them. And they sure as hell don't find themselves magically unable to access their own servicemembers' records while they're in another country. It's like...not how *any* of this works."
lxphj6y,"That has never made any sense to me. A Colonel makes like 90 something thousand a year. If bro has spent THAT much money then some random person working a normal job isn’t gonna be able to help them much. 

If you have the time to spare, what’s fun to do is play them along. Get info out of them. 

How long have you been in?
What’s your job?
What’s your unit? 
Where are you stationed? 
Why are you there?

And then proceed to poke holes in their story."
lxptj4n,"They don't spend much time on a potential victims that ask too many questions. But usually the story is that the funds on their account are locked because of some complicated sounding reason, and as a result they can't go on leave/return from deployment. If you know anything about the military, you know that story doesn't make any sense, but again, they don't spend time on people like that."
lxpvtak,Bet they are going some random desperate chick or old lady is gonna get the message and not actually think it though. I hope people who orchestrate those scams get impassable kidney stones.
lxptncc,">A Colonel makes like 90 something thousand a year

A Colonel is making way more than 90k a year, shit I'm an E-6 and my PSMC (end of year breakdown of pay) shows I made 94k last year. I wouldn't be even remotely surprised to see a full bird pulling double that, easily."
lxpv5dm,"I forget the exact number, been a bit since I last checked. Base pay for a full bird is over 8k a month coming out to over 90k a year. I was going low to keep from over shooting it. 

But their reasoning just makes absolutely zero sense. Like why contact a random citizen you have never personally met? Isn’t that why the JAG corps exists? To handle legal issues? 

When I get those emails if I have free time, I’m willing to do the research as to what units are based where and calculate their time in grade to poke holes. It’s fun to make them scramble to explain themselves. I will do a ton of research on random shit just to piss someone off. Never underestimate my ability to be spiteful."
lxr95js,"O-6 pay starts at 8k a month for less than 2 years in service. It takes 15 years minimum to make Colonel, so that part of the pay chart is never used. 


Realistic starting O-6 base pay is 11-12k a month, plus another 25-35% on top of that for housing and subsistence."
lxpxp20,"That's base pay man. Base pay is a *tiny* fraction of income in the military, *especially* for higher officers and those in special positions."
lxrahok,"Not a tiny fraction, base pay is 2/3rds to 3/4ths of the total pay for higher officers. 


And that's a higher portion than lower ranks. Base pay scales up faster by rank than BAH and BAS. Which makes sense, since being higher rank doesn't necessarily mean you need humongous house or tons of food."
lxrf5ns,"My MIL has fallen for THREE of these scams. She's dating someone from her work place now, but for the last three years she was hook line and sinker for these romance scammers. It was always the same story too- some kind of high ranking military dude who was locked out of his bank account OR trapped in a foreign country and needed her to marry him to get him back to the states. One of them in particular  got over 15,000 dollars out of her over the span of about 9 months to a year. Then she went and fell for it two more times. Some people you really just can't convince it's bullshit."
ly1wdcw,That’s terrible & sad!  I’m so happy she found someone close by to date.  Companionship is so important and it’s terrible that people take advantage.
lxrwnpy,"When I was an Army IG I got tons of these from people who had been scammed.  One was still sending money even after we told her it was a scam.  We explained that the person didnt eixst and even if they did they would never need private money for anything.  She responded ""You are just part of the coverup.""

SMH"

Me: ""Stolen valor is a federal crime, if you can contact me you can contact your government fuck buddies. Bye"""
lxs1jfh,"My aunt fell for this one... Twice. Not kidding. She had a podcast for Senior Citizens and she decided to do research on Online Romance Scams and got scammed herself in the process. Sent over $10k to help with ""the cause"", her kids found out and stopped it, and then she got scammed again the same way. Almost $50k sent over a year. Again, not kidding, in fact I wish I were.

They answer, ""Yes, it's me!""

Then I waste their time on the phone, acting like I'm concerned, etc."
lxsm1xq,"I'd go with 'Well Bobby, I told you what would happen if you got caught up with those drug running meatheads!  If you want me to bail you out, then you'll need to tell me where you stashed the money!  I ain't doing shit for you for free!'"

lxsqjyo,Best comment  🏆
lxphugx,This is always fun. My grandfather would just play “confused old man” till the other person got frustrated and hung up.
lxq3ek4,"I scrolled too far to see this one as it hits too close to home. My grandmother sent them $8000 in a bank draft through Purolater to get me out of “jail”. 

She called me on my cell the next day after she sent it and asked if I was okay and if I’ll be going to court. After her explaining the details and me breaking the news to her she started crying on the phone. Hearing my grandmother cry like that hit me so hard. 

I fucking hate those scammers with every ounce of my being."
lxpaisi,"There will be hackers on FB that will post something on your friend's page saying ""so tragic we will miss him""

If you ever see that and are really concerned contact your friend directly--never click on anything in those posts"
lxq5oha,"Not surprised that older people fall for those scams though, a lot aren’t that tech savvy and sometimes there’s mental decline involved as well. And sometimes even if the old person understands something is wrong they can’t defend themselves as well as a younger person. People scamming seniors are another level of evil."
lxqd13r,Unfortunately these are about to get way more refined due to AI
lxqag2u,"Oh this one has started becoming very popular in my country. Funny story, they call my mom to tell her that her son was in the hospital, while both me and my brother were in the same room with her. Not funny story, my grandma almost took the bait in another case, but we managed to avert it."
lxpr5ff,"One tried that with my grandma. She had 2 grandsons and the voice on the other end of the call could've been either of theirs. She fell for her share of scams, unfortunately, and probably would've fallen for that one, too, had they not said yes when she went ""Josh?"" It immediately clicked that the number wasn't from the prison, where my cousin Josh was incarcerated at the time, and he obviously wasn't broke down while on vacation in another state."
lxq3z4e,"Your grandma’s very lucky, I already posted above to the original comment how my grandmother fell for one. 

The “grandma I’m in jail and need money” and me being the trouble maker growing up she instantly responded with my name without even asking which one of her grandchildren was calling. To which it just made it an easier set up for the scammers to get her - she swears the voice on the line sounded just like me - how much you can trust an old woman’s hearing I’m not to sure. Has me curious about deepfake voice possibilities but I don’t know. 

All I know is hearing my grandma cry over the phone over falling for one gave me a burning hatred for scammers."
lxs1anr,"I actually fell for a more high tech/advanced one of these. The scammers hacked my friend's Snapchat and were sending me messages pretending to be him, drunk and in a tight spot (that wasn't well-explained, but I figured it was just because he's drunk), and I got locked out of my Venmo so can you send the money to my friend?

The scammers picked a really good mark. That friend is exactly the kind of person who would do that. It would not be the first time I'd Venmo'd him enough money for an Uber home. And then the scammers got bold and kept asking for more. I started thinking *he* was getting shaken down. I was telling him ""This sounds like you're getting scammed, tell me where you are, I'll send you an Uber."" The conversation devolved and I finally called his phone number directly so he'd quit drunk-panic-spiraling and just tell me where the fuck he was.... and his phone was off. That's when I realized *I* was getting scammed. 

Hard lesson learned: sending money to friends requires Facetime."
lxr77zs,With advancements in deepfake tech they're going to get a lot better over the next few years. Where they'll scrape your data on social media and find your grandkid's social media and clone their voice and info.
lxru0oh,Yup. It’s a huge problem. We like to think that we won’t fall for that but you never know.
lxs4io6,"Honestly I'd wager that there will thanks to those advances in deepfakes/ai/digital trickery be a whole industry revolving around physical transmission. Like contracts will go back to being signed with ink, important papers will be physically couriered, that kind of thing."
lxtncot,"Exactly. Very scary technique. Would say: hang up the phone, call them back and when they answer and everything is fine, you know it was a scam."
lxrps1m,I’m glad that my grandmother is as smart as she is at 96. She got a call a few years ago saying it was her “grandson” and I was in the custody of the Mexican police and I needed $5000 to get out. She asked if she could call them back and then she called both me and my only other male cousin. Both of us were not in Mexico at the time.
lxrtwog,Good that your grandma was on top of things. My ex MIL is quite gullible and hard of hearing. She got a call from my son saying he was in  an accident. We live 450 miles away but he happened to be working in her area. She was suspicious so she got the information and then called the police!
lxrw293,"""Heyyy gurl it's me, your deskmate from 8th grade! I need money, can you help or are you broke?"""
lxryz3v,"Once had my rich friend message my broke ass, saying she's made a lot of mistakes in life and is struggling to survive and needs financial support.

For context, we were 15 and she still lived with her parents.

Though it was written in a very convincing way for those who didn't know her closely. A classmate of ours got that message too from her hacked account, and he came to her in class to politely decline her request for money. She was extremely confused cause she didn't realise she was hacked.

We had some good laughs about it."
lxu70yf,"My wife's grandfather got hit by one of these. Luckily he didn't send them any money but the scammers were particularly persistent. Lots of follow up calls with fake crying, saying they were my brother-in-law, etc.

Makes me so mad"
lxs660r,"given that they're replicating people's voices now, it's very understandable that people fall for that one

set a ""family password"" with your relatives"
lxs7g20,"Not the policehospital! How many giftcards should I get, sweaty?"
lxu8cx3,My grandma nearly fell for this one until she looked at the number.
lxwj16q,"Reminds me of a story my husband told me. His grandma got a call like this. Fortunately, she basically said if this is fake, go to hell, but if it is real, then you got yourself into this mess so you can get yourself out. Thankfully it was a scam"
lxp0rsh,"The amount of people who put their trust in apps like Snapchat believing them to be 100% secure and private and that everything they send on there, yes EVERYTHING,  isn't stored in some server somewhere with their verified details attached to it all.... because.... Snapchat saves everything you send on there and there are countless examples of that information being retrieved and leaked online. 

It's also incredibly easy to install work around which don't notify the person of images being screenshotted, so another reason to not blindly assume it's some super secure social media platform."
lxpef0d,"Or any random app for that matter. I downloaded a crossword puzzle app and it asked for permission to access my microphone. I immediately deleted it. 

A lot of these ""free"" apps just want to datamine you."
lxsg8k3,"What's the old saying, ""if something is free, then *YOU* the product"". 

Similarly I question when the stock Google calculator tells me I need to update it. Like, why? Is there a new way to do math now?"
lxptczj,">A lot of these ""free"" apps just want to datamine you.

*Every* ""free"" app wants and does that. People don't spend months/years developing apps for no reason."
lxqi25w,"There are a lot of apps that start out as hobbyist projects and get hijacked later on.

When I recently transitioned phones, an app that basically adds widgets to your home screen (purely cosmetic) got updated and suddenly needed full permissions for everything."
lxq15pu,"Lot of free apps are monetized by running ads, or have a freemium model where they try to get you to subscribe"
lxq59cq,"Not shady per se. It depends on an API they use. Sometimes they ask for permission to read contact information. Not to abuse it, but because they have a ""share"" UI that utilizes it. So it ""could"" be unrelated to shady practices."
lxp6up4,The FBI literally has a backdoor into the app and has their own server of data for Snapchat.
lxq6iuo,"It's actually kind of clever when you think about it. People are more brazen on Snapchat because ""it's not permanent"" in their eyes. I wouldn't be surprised if Snapchat was actually some kind of government honeypot to catch criminals."
lxq7vos,"The FBIs backdoor is called a subpoena.

They don't need to backdoor Snapchat, they just ask Snapchat for your messages and Snapchat gives the messages to the FBI."
lxryxzy,That's only if the government is utilizing the legal process. NSA already has everything that's ever touched any part of the US telecom infrastructure.
lxs2z2a,"FBI, NSA, DEA, etc have systems actively monitoring cellular and online data, as well as backdoors into many online services, operating systems, and devices. They no longer have to go and request logs in court for many reasons."
lxpfvva,I’m super grateful that Apple has recently started giving notifications about apps having access to your photos for x amount of days. I’ve started managing access to photos instead of just giving apps a free for all of my photos
lxpn8jl,Reading the Windows privacy policy really made me appreciate the Apple approach. They aren’t perfect but it’s still better I think.
lxpof0h,Oh I agree! Like obviously if you like do something crazy illegal they aren’t going to protect your privacy but even their speech to text is all in-house so to speak so that’s why it’s not as good as google’s and Microsoft’s
lxpi9ja,"Add to this the ""fun"" surveys like...tell us the story of you and your partner and asks for anniversary date and major locations. Or info about you - how many pets do you have? What are their names? 


..these are all common security questions. Stop giving away your personal information on social media because it's fun.


Plus the ""show is your 10 year glow up!"" Or ""a picture of you as a kid vs today. It's all AI training. "
lxqm3be,"I remember being baffled watching Now You See Me - a movie in which a group of hustlers steal millions from a rich git by asking him a few basic questions.

It had never occured to me that people would use the relevant, honest answers to security questions. After all, I know most of my family and friends' pets names, mothers' maiden names etc and presumably they know mine. It's like having your date of birth as the PIN for your front door, and actually writing ""What is your date of birth"" on the keypad. Why would anyone ever use that sort of freely accessible information for security?

Then I learnt the simple explanation: far too many people are idiots."
lxpuput,No they do clear out information periodically. That being specific messages and images. It costs a lot to store that much data especially when they aren’t profiting off of 99% of it.
lxpx8p5,"Not to mention the easiest of methods, having another camera to take pictures of the picture."
lxpqteh,"I don't understand how Snapchat still has a reputation for having a ""feature"" that nukes messages, images, and videos off its database."
lxpr5fd,"They have essentially build a reputation on a lie, that everything you do on there is private between you and whoever you choose to share that content with. When in actual fact, SC explicitly mentions in their TOU that everything use share on their stored on their servers and linked to your account."
lxprfgy,"You're right.

It's incredible that they still managed to exempt themselves from the ""everything on the internet is forever"" rule."
lxrzqwr,"fun fact you can straight up request all your data from them too. all your saved snapchat logs, pics, stories, comes in handy if someone is acting like chris d'elia and you wanna leak/report it, but people use it to save all your nudies to their desktop. DONT SEND NUDIES TO STRANGERS ON SC!"
lxqaznj,I love the look on Chris D'Elia's face when he's on a podcast and someone's talking about how it's easy to copy messages from snapchat and how nothing is ever really deleted. He's just doing the mental maths in his head of exactly how cooked he is.
lxqxncn,">work around which don't notify the person of images being screenshotted

lxt1jhz,"I'm going to get downvoted for this, but door to door isn't always a scam. Sometimes it is, and that shit ruins it for the legit companies. I'm speaking from experience here, having done this type of work for legitimate companies with quality products, managed those sales teams/offices, and been a director of specialized marketing programs. 

It's a marketing strategy that has worked for decades and continues to do so, according to a recent Forbes article. Probably one of the cheapest ways for companies to get the word out about their product, as nearly all d2d workers are 1099 and paid commission only with no benefits like health insurance or retirement savings programs. Like it or not, and I totally get why a lot of people don't, the capitalist society in which we live means that companies are going to save money everywhere they can, and everyone being shitty to the person at their door who's just trying to pay bills or feed their family does not even consider this. (Granted, if that knocker is an ass, as unfortunately some are, then hey, do what you gotta do.)

Problem is, YMMV depending on the salesperson and/or the company. I'm all about more regulation in my current industry to provide more consumer protection, because bad actors fucking people over not only piques my sense of injustice, but has essentially made it way more difficult to do the job than it needs to be and directly impacted my income pretty significantly and recently. 

What a lot of people don't think about is that there are bad actors in every industry. Healthcare, hospitality, government, law, utilities, everything. If you buy a car and have a bad experience or end up with a lemon, do you never buy another car again? Most people do. 

The Internet can only help so much. And yeah, I completely understand that most people just want to seek out the things that they want when they want it and not have it presented to them unsolicited, which is totally fair. But how does one learn that the thing they want is out there, or even that they might actually want/need it, beyond basics like food and shelter? Marketing. For pretty much everything. In all kinds of ways. 

Idk. I know I sound a little crazy, but let's not major in the minors here. Capitalism means that a majority of people have to do whatever they can to make ends meet. I think we need to turn a more critical eye to the companies/systems and be kind to each other individually."
ly0k763,"Well said, you raise a fair point.  Rethinking this, if I was the one going door-to-door with something awesome, I'd like a few minutes of peoples time too. We just got so many day after day, that we just put up the sign."

lxrij7d,Zero. None. That's why organic produce is an absolute sham.
lxsn6ao,"Zero what? Zero trace amounts? That's not true.The EPA sets limits on how much pesticide is tolerated on produce when it's sold. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide_residue

It's a very small amount, but it's non-zero. I'm sure they set that # based on all available data, but often we don't have good data on long term health risks, so there's only so much that can be taken into account.

There's also studies like [this](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/22/health/organic-food-cancer-study/index.html), which found eating organic produce correlates negatively with cancer risk. Of course correlation isn't causation. Eating organic produce can correlate with income or general attitude towards health, which can explain the decreased risk. But it could also be the lower toxicity of organic pesticides at the trace amounts allowed by the EPA. 

My point is long-term health risks of the trace amounts of pesticides found on produce are under studied. People shouldn't be so confident in proclaiming that synthetic pesticides don't pose any larger health risks than organic ones. It's possible, but if people want to spend a little more to decrease this possible risk that's a rational decision."
lxsuiem,"Zero meaning, zero current pesticides are toxic when consumed in trace amounts. Not zero pesticides left. 

That study asks whether people consumed organic foods or not. It did not compare equal diets of conventional and organic foods. There is a lower cancer risk associated with a generally healthy diet and those who eat organic fruits and vegetables are eating fruits and vegetables. The others very well may just never be eating any fruit and vegetables. I even buy organic sometimes because the conventional version isn't available, and would fall into the ""organic"" group, but I fall into that group because I eat a generally healthy diet. They didn't control for this very obvious bias which is why the conclusion of the study says ""further research is necessary to determine the underlying cause in this association."" 

Here is a systematic review (highest level of evidentiary support on Melnyk's pyramid) of 35 papers (including the study you linked as citation 53) that is the ""further research"" your solitary study called for showing the exact bias I mentioned. 

""While findings from this systematic review showed significant positive outcomes from observational studies in several areas, including reduced incidence of metabolic syndrome, high BMI, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, infertility, birth defects, allergic sensitisation, otitis media and pre-eclampsia, the current evidence base does not allow a definitive statement on the long-term health benefits of organic dietary intake. Consumption of organic food is often tied to overall healthier dietary practices and lower levels of overweight and obesity, which are likely to be influential in the results of observational research.""

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019963/

For what it's worth the FDA has banned several synthetic pesticides that were toxic in trace amounts, but also had to ban severeal organic/natural pesticides growers were using that were toxic to humans in trace amounts...like arsenic. Arsenic is an organic pesticide. Are you okay with consuming trace amounts of arsenic daily? Probably not. Thankfully for you, neither is the FDA cuz organic producers are just as greedy as conventional ones.

Any pesticide's base function is to kill living things, natural or not. The poison is in the dose. Botulinum toxin is my favorite example of this. One gram of it can kill a million people. It's natural existence is why we don't allow babies to eat any kind of honey (organic, all natural, whatever, actually fake honey would be less of a risk). But manufacture it synthetically, and you have botox.

Natural =/= better. Nature really didn't take into consideration your mortality when it started forming. Some of nature, a lot of it actually, actively tries to kill humans. It's why we need shelter, hand washing, pesticides, and modern medicine to achieve what is now considered normal life expectancy. When life was all natural centuries ago, people died a lot younger."
lxtqvap,"> They didn't control for this very obvious bias which is why the conclusion of the study says ""further research is necessary to determine the underlying cause in this association.""

I already called out that lack of that control in my original comment. Please read my full comment before responding. 

> Of course correlation isn't causation. Eating organic produce can correlate with income or general attitude towards health, which can explain the decreased risk. But it could also be the lower toxicity of organic pesticides at the trace amounts allowed by the EPA.

It seem like the meta review you linked supports my point.

> Significant positive outcomes were seen in longitudinal studies where increased organic intake was associated with reduced incidence of infertility, birth defects, allergic sensitisation, otitis media, pre-eclampsia, metabolic syndrome, high BMI, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The current evidence base does not allow a definitive statement on the health benefits of organic dietary intake. However, a growing number of important findings are being reported from observational research linking demonstrable health benefits with organic food consumption. Future clinical research should focus on using long-term whole-diet substitution with certified organic interventions as this approach is more likely to determine whether or not true measurable health benefits exist.

Eating organic food correlates with better health outcomes. It could be because of what *I originally* described above, that people who eat organic food are generally more health conscious, or it could be that eating trace amounts of synthetic pesticides over a long period of time to actually contribute to worse health outcomes. We don't have the data to say which it is right now. Until we do it's a rational decision to hedge your risks by paying extra money to buy organic produce."
lxtwazk,"We do have the data. You can look at the thousands of studies that link obesity, tobacco use, and alcohol use to these ailments and they explain the difference between ""organic and conventional"" diets. The trends of obesity and disease over decades correlating with increasingly unhealthy diets. All pathologies are greatly reduced by healthier lifestyle habits exclusive of organic produce. I would argue if you were to plot organic to conventional (not counting for general diet) versus disease on a graph, and overlay a graph of average BMI compared to obesity versus disease prevelance, they would be identical.

You also failed to touch on the fact that natural pesticides have been shown to cause harm in trace amounts and have been banned. So I'm kinda curious where buying organic is a rational decision when the FDA has had to force organic producers to stop poisoning people. Seems really risky to me.

It's also not a rational decision financially when so many struggle to even afford conventional produce. When faced with the fallacy that conventional produce is bad for you, what do those most vulnerable to obesity and related health ailments eat?

At the end of the day, *if* organic produce actually has an impact on health, it is so miniscule it can't even be measured and is effectively irrelevant. There is also risk that natural chemicals meant to kill living organisms might be harmful to humans in trace amounts, the same as synthetic. Which makes it nowhere near worth the financial investment."
lxpnhyr,"Organic doesn't really mean much for most products. My parents looked into it for their farm and for things like eggs, it just meant not washing them with some chemicals, but others were fine. Same for produce, many organic vegetables are still treated with herbicides or insecticides.

lyr2z6j,"Several organic farmers markets around the US and Canada have been found to be buying there produce from the local distributors the same as regular grocery stores. They just swap the boxes for their own label and pub stickers that say Organic or similar buzz words. It is a serious problem. A friend's family used to own several farmers markets that only bought from actual local farmers. They only allowed honey sellers who had their own hives and NOT people who just sold the exact same jars you can buy at walmart. (seriously, exact same honey) they often has HFCS added in) And for twice as much as you can buy it at wm. That is bottled in factories where ever, but certainly not local. They almost artnered with a family that owned several other farmers markets. But after visiting them, they saw employees swapping out the boxes from the big distributors for the grocery stores and putting them in baskets ect. Having things that are no way in season in our area, but labeling it as local produce. So they decided not to merge. In the end, they sold their locations because when you do things legitimately, you cannot hope to make the money that the scammers make. And they would hear people comment things like. ""these strawberries and watermelons are beautiful, and the samples taste amazing. But the farmers market down the road is cheaper."" or ""They dont have avocados, lets go to the other place."" in December. And shit like that. 

They always worked with real small farmers ect...

lxsvbns,"The first article talks about how a small % of organic products don't mean the standards set out by the guidelines, either because of cross contamination with non organic produce, gaps of enforcement, or fraud from foreign exporters. 

The last article's main point on healthiness of food is 

> They [the meta study] concluded that fruits and vegetables that met the criteria for “organic” were on average no more nutritious than their far cheaper conventional counterparts, nor were those foods less likely to be contaminated by pathogenic bacteria like E. coli or Salmonella.

Those are definitely things to take into account, but I don't think they back up your original statement that organic food regulations are meaningless. In response to the first article I would say, nobody should expect regulations to be followed 100% of the time. There are always a small amount of violations. That doesn't change the fact that the vast majority of organic produce is in compliance.

In response to the last article I would say that increased nutrition or decreased bacterial contamination was never really a goal of organic regulations. An apple is an apple, regardless of which pesticides you use, and no produce should have bacterial contamination.

Organic is basically a big pile of marketing misinformation. Organic producers like to talk about what they **could*** do for pest control, but most just hose super deadly (but natural!) poison all over everything. The same type of produce can taste different depending on the specific variety and how it was grown. Being Non-Organic doesn't mean they didn't grow a good crop, it just means they didn't meet some arbitrary standards. Non-Organic / GMO produce are just as healthy, and capable of tasting just as good or better than organic produce. Any perceived difference between the these labels is psychological caused by marketing. There are plenty of videos of someone cutting a fruit in half, labeling one half as organic and the other half as GMO, and people who believe in Organic will rave about how much better that half tastes until being told it's the same fruit.

The only real alternative is to learn to grow your own food, or find a local farmer you can trust.

As a kid, my mum got me a single stock in Cadbury's as a silly novelty. It was worth pennies, but was pretty cool to be able to claim I owned a share in the chocolate company.

In my early 20s, suddenly I got a phone call from a company attempting a hostile takeover of Cadburys. They were trying to buy up all forgotten shares from small shareholders. Pretty convincing, they were offering me almost 30% higher than the share value (about £0.50 per share) which didn't raise any red flags - if anything I didn't think it would be worth my time.

They then informed me that my dividends had been too small (fractions of pennies) to be sent and had thus been reinvested into more shares. Apparently each share held in the mid 90s was now a few dozen shares. They hadn't asked me for anything, so still no red flags.

A few weeks later they contacted me with a final offer of about £170. Apparently my shares had multiplied when they merged with Schweppes - a merger I didn't know about but proved real when googled. Not a problem, I was happy to send them the address of my local post office where I could collect the check and fill out any relevant paperwork. That one share worth pennies had multiplied to £170 seemed suspicious, but they hadn't asked for anything other than reasonable sounding paperwork so I wasn't bothered.

They emailed me the paperwork, in which it transpired my shares were worth £1,700 due to a miscalculation earlier in the process. Rolling my eyes I read the rest, and was less surprised than I'd hoped to find that I had to wire them a 10% ""deposit"" to validate my account details.

Honestly, the amount of time I'd spent on the phone didn't feel worth the £170 to me by the end. That they paid someone for that time with no guarantee they'd even get anything out of it baffles me."

First thing that clued me in was that the person clearly did not know how to play the guitar. Second, the people who came up came in shifts and shared the same sign. Third, one guy messed up and dropped the guitar but the music kept playing. 

And yet people still donated money."

Granted, I've bought extended warranties on both appliances and cars. And have certainly had experiences where I've been thankful the product was under warranty. To say it will pay for itself in all situations, however, isn't true. I also don't fault the salesman who has seen the warranty save a customer from spending a lot out of pocket.

I think consumers should be looking at them like a gamble. An extended warranty on my Subaru is like $2K.

They also have advertising budgets that they use to promote the thing further through social media and news outlets.

I’ve had my identity stolen before, so I wasn’t surprised snd was just grateful they found the charges early on. I googled the number and it was the same # as my bank.

They had identifying info about me that not just anyone would have and asked me verifying questions after that my bank asks me any time I have called them before. It was so, so believable and I was already in a stressed mental state prior to the call. When I called my bank directly the next day, even the employee told me it was legitimate. It wasn’t until I called again that an employee dug into their logs of texts/calls to me that they determined it was fake. Luckily, I was only out about 1.5 hours of my time in total with talking to the scammer, changing card and bank numbers, updating accounts, etc and didn’t lose a dime.

Main lesson I learned: If your bank calls you for ANY reason, hang up and call them directly. Don’t be dumb like me.

Edited to add: When they were sending me texts to verify things / help me add the card alerts to my phone, the confirmation texts came from a number that I’ve gotten legitimate texts from my bank before. They’re too smart!!"

They were very good about reminding me they would never ask for my password, confirmation code, or username, they sounded legit, everything. I was skeptical, but not so skeptical as to hang up, right until the confirmation that I had the phone number text message. Told them I didn’t recognize the number from which it came (never got a text from it before, and I’m signed up for text alerts for every transaction), so give me a moment to verify it wasn’t a scammer—*click!* They were the ones who hung up."

It was real but she didn’t need to panic.

I was like,  ""hey,  you know all that's fake right? Like these rocks are just rocks not magic?""


Yeah that was an argument.

Now my oldest daughter is getting into them,  and she now will not be able to sleep unless she has her sleep rock under her pillow. It actually caused a huge problem when she lost the rock and was purposefully staying up at night to prove how exhausted she was without the rock. I had the same talk with her,  about how it is not real and it's supposed to be a fun little thing you do. Once it actually negatively affects your mood then it's no longer a fun little thing. Another argument because I was being a hypocrit since Mom believes in the rocks and I don't tell her otherwise. Only because we don't like to hash things out in front of our kids,  but damn they're just rocks."

The thing is, it's all symbolic and metaphorical stuff. You can make a rune casting or tarot reading mean whatever you want, as long as it's the vague ""guideline"" the table has on it. But it gets you thinking how to piece it together, and that thinking can be really constructive."

It's of course not about the image but about the blockchain, which confirms ownership. It's easily comparable to art for example, except that you can just generate more NFT's and sell them to people if you just have a brand. I guess that's where it becomes a scam...

And no, I would never buy an NFT."
lxoyczs,Political propaganda.
lxp0cmr,"Unfortunately, no one is immune to propaganda."
lxp16ho,"It’s harder to see propaganda that aligns with your world view, and easier to spot propaganda that conflicts with your worldview, but all propaganda can definitely be objectively discerned.

One thing that makes it difficult though is that people don’t know everything, so in the areas where we don’t have any information, we might be naive and easy to dupe.

——-——

edit: this also applies to areas where we have bad information, whether outdated, fallacious logic, misinformation, or disinformation. We are easily duped when propaganda plays toward this or builds upon disinformation that has been instilled over time.

second edit: it would be more accurate if I were to use the word “deceitful”. I know that not all propaganda is deceitful, such as ads to get people to stop drinking and driving, or political messages for the masses that are honest, as those can certainly exist.

Politics is quite dirty. There are a lot of decitful people in politics. So don’t go blindly believing that what politicians tell you and which fits into their self interest is accurate. But don’t assume that everything a politician tells you is a lie either. You need to check things out for yourself by checking out information from many sides or by comparing the source information with what politicians and news outlets say about it. Then you can determine for yourself who has a habit of lying.

here is the essence as an analogy: you’re in elementary school and Cynthia hastes Sue. Cynthia tells everyone that Sue eats bugs in the field everyday after school. You have caught Cynthia lying before about you so you know that Cynthia sometimes lies. This is logical information. You decide to look For yourself and secretly spy on sue (you’re five) for a few days after elementary school in the field as she leaves and you see for yourself that she doesn’t eat bugs. This is sensory information. Of course, the limitation is that you only spent a few days looking for yourself, but you saw that at least part of what Cynthia said is false. you now have a few good reasons to suspect Cynthia is lying.

tldr: politicians benefit from you believing what they tell you. We need to find logical ways to discern truth rather than building up a mental map based on the words of others. If you fact check lies with another liar, or a mindless repeater, you’ll just be more entrenched in a lie."

lxrtrus,"The thing about a lot of that propaganda is that it takes from legitimate artistic movements that share a similar worldview. It's often a lot more organic than ""let's make up random stuff to fool people"".

Our division is their strength."
lxr1lxq,">	Most countries have a two party political system

This is exactly the opposite of the truth. Very few countries in the world have two party systems or even multi-party systems where two parties dominate.

In the vast majorities of democratic countries there are many political parties with varying and constantly shifting levels of representation in parliament. America, Britain, and Australia are really the only large countries with this two party dynamic."
lxpj9hf,"I think you bring up a good point. While politcal parties and their makeup is one matter, some being more honest or virtuous, and some being less so, coupled with somewhat uninformed or illogical masses (I’m talking about people, not just one group of voters) creates a perverse incentive.

A leader should strive to be virtuous and honest in conduct and speech. But cynical people might lie for the vote or vilify people who vote for the other guy.

back to your point, because polarization and truth are two different things (albeit intertwined), though nuance can sometimes be lacking in two party systems for the reasons you described, we can strive to personally have nuance in our interactions with others. 

Don’t seek to put people in boxes, but look for the best in them. What is the best thing about that person you disagree with politically? What are some values you both share? Maybe you have similar values but different information. You can disagree politically and both be good people."

People shouldn’t rely on social media for news and assume that the information they have been presented with is reliable. 

Especially with proliferation of bots, and the ability to present a false picture. Traditional news media can in and of itself be misleading, be propaganda presented as news, be edited in such a way that it is deceptive in that it looks like you are seeing or hearing something that has happened, but are being led into a false picture of events.

people generally won’t have time to look into the sources used for news and watch unedited footage, read press releases and so forth, but if we do this for a few critical reports on hot button topics, we can determine who lies when they report, and who doesn’t, or who lies about what, minimizing the amount of disinformation we consume."

lxpeau4,"I mean, it's not a guarantee that a ""wedding"" dress will be marked up like wild. I think chain stores like David's have fallen out of favor with a *lot* of women, but good deals can be had.

We had a small wedding part (two per side plus us). I got myself and my two groomsmen tailored suits for about $650 each. My wife went to David's Bridal and got her wedding dress plus her two bridesmaids' dresses for less than one of my suits (somewhere in the $500 range out the door for her). She looked an absolute picture at the wedding, and the dress looked phenomenal. And it was absolutely a ""wedding"" dress at the store.

Like anything, YMMV, but I really feel like weddings are as expensive as what you fall for. It was pretty easy for us to make inexpensive choices without compromising the experience for us and our guests. Don't put on the blinders that make you ignore prices.

We provided our own alcohol. I think we spent the most on the venue, honestly. My point is, you may not value the wedding dress, but others might."
lxu1mvw,"My point is, the word “wedding” gives the seller a reason to tack on much extra to the price without any extra cost to themselves or the manufacturers. 

If buying a “wedding dress” is important to you than considering any dress out there, I don’t care. You’re paying a premium for that. That’s my point. 

I’ve made many many wedding cakes, and my bosses talked constantly about how much they could charge because “people will spend more for their wedding”. It’s a racket. There’s no reason for it. When I do wedding cakes on my own for clients, they’re priced the same as any other cake I do, based purely on size and complexity.

They take advantage of the fact that most people don’t actually read their holy texts unless they’re in service . As such the preachers can say what ever they want and most people will go along with it . They’re hypocrites. That’s why if you look at the root of the problem with most people who suffer from religious trauma , it boils down to what ever religious group they’re a part of being hypocritical. Whether a person was sexually assaulted , punished due to some “ ism “,  or just simply shamed due to a random action they committed or some other reason , the issue bottles down to hypocrisy .

the catch is , these horrible people would be horrible with or without religion . They’re just weaponizing religion to achieve their goals .

lxpyqqn,"I use my VPN for ONE reason, with several uses following from that reason. I'm stationed in South Korea and I don't want the Korean version of Netflix. Also: Internet porn is illegal here. Thanks to my VPN, I never left the good old US of A!"
lxpz8bc,"That's a legitimate use of a VPN, even if it does skirt the edge of a few Terms of Service conditions. That's not my concern.

My issue with VPNs is they are sold as the be all and end all of internet security and privacy. If that's your sole reason for having one, you've been sold on an idea that's only marginally better than flushing your money down the toilet."

Unless it is Mullvad I don't trust them."
lxtykj7,"Tom Scott is honest about VPNs when sponsoring them. And AFAIK he caused a lot of VPN companies to start paying attention to what their employees do for marketing as well, so a lot of other YouTubers essentially followed Tom's lead."
lxtrv5d,Internet porn is illegal there? Good on them!
lxqpul4,"There's only 3 reasons anyone should use a VPN: if you want to access services or websites that are unavailable in your country; torrenting in specific countries (if you don't know what that is then I guarantee you don't have to worry about this); or if you need to connect to a remote network (in this case your VPN would either be provided by the company you work at or you'd set up a VPN yourself on your own machine. Again, if you don't know what this means then you don't need to worry about this). VPNs don't provide any meaningful privacy, if anything they just make you less private because now the VPN company has all your data"
lxr52s1,"Not to mention how the VPN still needs to point that data to a location,  which is still a physical location, with a physical device, with its own device ID and MAC address, and IP address,  *and* you can find this location online because some assholes went around the world and mapped out wireless signal identification data Google maps style almost everywhere in populated places. So you can right now go to that site (I'm not posting it here) and find your address and it'll have the IDs of every signal coming from your home. All your smart devices, anything with Bluetooth, any wifi signals, your router, and it'll have serial numbers and model numbers and everything. So if you haven't changed your router gui password, all you need is the model number and you can look up the default password and get into that router easily. Like VPNs are the final layer of protection, not the first or only layer. There is so much information passing from you to the whole world that unless you are a cyber security wizard or have only hardline connections that you are unplugged from constantly,  the chances that a VPN will protect you from someone seeking to do you damage are not that high."

lxp95tl,"A federal pardon can be issued prior to the start of a legal case or inquiry. Nixon hadn’t even been charged with anything when Gerald Ford pardoned him. 

Pardons have been used by the president in presumptive cases before, and Trump was no stranger to pardoning people. He pardoned a *lot* of his friends while he was in office, and he had just as much authority to pardon everyone who stormed the Capitol on January 6th."
lxp99a5,"But also he wasn’t president anymore, right?"
lxp9h5b,"He was president for a whole 2 weeks after January 6th.

January 6th is when Congress certifies the election results. The actual transfer of power doesn’t happen until January 20th.

He was *absolutely* still president."
lxpsgex,There was no indication that they were going to pursue charges against these people or even knew who they were.  You wanted Trump to issue pardons for thousands of people or to chase down the few that would eventually have charges brought upon them?  I don't think he's hiding a time machine from us.
lxptxxz,">there was no indication that they were going to pursue charges against the people that stormed the Capitol with the exclaimed goal of “hanging Mike Pence”

lxpb4iv,"It can take that long to *apply* for a pardon.

Once a presidential pardon is granted, it typically takes effect immediately. In some cases, there might be a delay in the official documentation and notification process, but this delay is usually brief and doesn’t affect the legal status of the pardon."
lxpaask,">Pardons typically take months, sometimes years.

When the accused is requesting them and then has to convince the governor/president to issue one.

But a governor or president only has to sign a piece of paper to actually issue a pardon.  Takes about 5 minutes for a staffer to write it up, a second or two to sign."

lxvf00z,Yeah this really isn't what the average voter thinks.

It is objectively true that Trump lies about ""his"" economy. It's objectively true that democrats run the economy better. Even TRUMP has said so.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRndMiVIB-w

Religious affiliation and anti-abortion, anti gay opinions are objectively intertwined. You're only lying to yourself by denying this fact. 

It's also objectively true that liberalism has been demonized by Trump and the right wing, despite the fact that it's one of the most important aspects of Democracy. (which is also now demonized by Trump and the right wing)

And they bring in more people when they really don't like the person who's speaking. I'm not really sure that you guys understand what the definition of fascist is. Because if you're going out there and trying to prevent someone from talking that makes you the fascist and so far I have yet to see a left-wing Democrat on a speaking tour getting shouted at or having to have police escorts to the building and outside the building because there were people trying to shut down their talk other than the recent Nancy pelosi interview.

He's a convicted felon.

He has made a fortune by taking advantage of bankruptcy laws in the U.S. over and over. Not illegal, but very shady business practices.

He lost a civil to a woman he sexually harassed.

He was convicted of a felony for falsifying business records to cover up a hush-money payment.

He was being prosecuted for obstructing congress (Jan 6).

He politicized the justice department when he was president (this is debatable, of course).

He traded pardons for loyalty commitments from convicted felons. This is well documented.

He withheld $400M congress had allocated for Ukraine.

He has profited from his presidency, which is a direct conflict of interest and highly unethical.

lxp3aaf,"If you compare the CO2 Emission per capita, the US polutes 13.3 t in 2023. In comparison, China ""only"" polutes 8.9 t per capita. Therefore, it would make a change, if the US would polute less. If you take the EU as a similarly developed environment with similar needs as the US, numbers are looking even worse: 5.4 t per capita in the EU Vs. 13.3 t per capita in the US. 
If the US would take similar measures as EU (more renewable energy, more EVs, less plastic, better public transportation, better recycling), it would make a significant change.

Here is the source to these numbers:

lxpp2mm,"This is interesting information, thank you."
lxpb77t,"And that’s the issue. Per capita calculations are missing the wide distribution of emissions based on income of individuals and the corporations that are creating it. The US has the most millionaires by a lot, I think we can understand how they produce more pollution and overconsumption than an individual with average income. Manufacturing and shipping cause much of the pollution as well, so by calculating per capita, all you’re doing is diluting by population size and effectively ignoring who is actually producing the bulk of it, whose changes would actually make an impact. 

When speaking of policy, it really doesn’t matter what the per capita is anyway. If China created a policy that would cut manufacturing emissions by 30%, that would equal a greater impact on co2 emissions than if the U.S. did. Again, per capita calculations isn’t really the right metric for this issue."
lxpxy6z,"In my opinion, it is hard to find a good measure to compare countries overall. If you know about a better one, please let me know, as I am curious to learn about it.
For the emissions from wealthy people and poor people you are right, rich people polute more then poor people. 
If you go away form comparing China to the US and instead compare EU and US, it might be easier to use the per capita metric (similar age structure of population, similar industry, similar distribution of wealth). Therefore, the US definitely also has potential to become more environmentally friendly overall. And as indicated above: every action makes a difference."

Originally, I liked the concept of being in charge of your own wealth without having to use a bank. There were of course huge barriers for that to happen. The biggest one, at least back in the day, was the time it took for the block chain to converge changes. It made things like using bitcoin in common places unreasonable. For example, back in the day you couldn't really pay for your groceries with bitcoin unless the receiver took a huge gamble that the exchange would clear because it would take 5-20 minutes to finish the block chain. Imagine scanning your groceries and then having to hang out in the store for like 30 minutes until the grocer said, ""Okay, your transaction cleared! Here's your receipt!""

In 2012, I was on board with it because I figured that eventually we would figure out how to overcome technical limitations to make the concepts that made crypto attractive to me, a reality. Unfortunately, that never really developed and now people mostly just use Bitcoin and analogs as currency speculation. While a few more places accept crypto as a legit form of payment, I feel like the vast majority of uses in the past 5 years have mostly revolved around rug pull/pump and dump schemes which is sad because I still like the premises that I originally liked in 2012.

I pulled out my original investment on the first wave when Bitcoin popped off, but I will probably never participate again. I know there are some crypto bros that will probably counter some of my thoughts on this but it doesn't matter. I feel like crypto has hurt far more people than it's helped and it's honestly just become yet another shelter for the wealthy to avoid taxes and increase wealth by taking advantage of poorer people looking for financial stability in a financially unstable world."

lxqh9fx,"I think you're generalising here, many people have profited (me included) off crypto like Bitcoin, some have obviously lost too. However for some, it is a long term investment, similar to something like S&P500. S&P500 obviously has more history and could well be a safer investment but people usually have crypto as a part of a diversified portfolio. 


I would never recommend anyone invest more in to crypto than they are willing to lose, but that's the same as with any investment. "
lxp9lvf,"I agree it's a scam, but you are taking such a black and white approach. I've made a lot of money investing in crypto over the last 10 years or so. I think the concept of crypto is idiotic, at least at this stage. You can't use Bitcoin as a currency if the value is going to be so insanely volatile. That said, you can absolutely make a stupid amount of money investing in crypto. 


Investing in crypto is pretty much like gambling though. I put a small amount of money (like $1k) in Bitcoin 10+ years ago. I was fully aware that it could go to zero at any moment, so I only put in money that I could afford to lose. That $1k probably would have turned into like a million damn dollars if I would have just held onto the Bitcoin I bought back then. You'd be pretty crazy to hold that long when the investment is going up thousands of percent though (particularly on something as fundamentally dumb as Bitcoin). It's important to be logical about your investment decisions, even if that doesn't necessarily lead to the best result. Technically looking back I should have cashed out my 401k and invested everything in Bitcoin and I'd be a billionaire! But Jesus Christ that would have been idiotic without the knowledge of hindsight.


Anyways, basically every year or two I sell and make several thousand of profit. Whenever the crypto market skyrockets I start dollar cost average selling. Even with taking all that profit I still have quite a bit invested, still just as gambling money as I know it could (and likely will) crash at any moment. Every few years I might invest a small amount more when the market really crashes.


All that to say that I agree it's a scam, but a scam in the way any gambling is a scam (lottery, casinos, sports betting, etc). You can make money on those things, but you've got to understand there is a very real chance (or even high probability) that you will lose everything. Hell, even the stock market is a scam to a degree. Especially with stocks like GameStop, but also with stocks like Tesla where the value is exponentially inflated. There's zero logical reason Tesla should have that level of market cap, so I think owning that stock is almost as much a ""scam"" as owning Bitcoin. It doesn't meeting people haven't made an absurd amount of money investing in Bitcoin and Tesla though."

lxp769f,"Stocks are backed by something of value. Crypto is backed by ""trust me bro this shitcoin is gonna go crazy"""
lxp33vp,Crypto is fake money you can't spend anywhere. Stocks is equity in a company which you will own a fraction of the shares. They are two completely different things.
lxp2p51,"Yeah I think stocks are actually a scam. We, as humans, could have made anything with this world and we decided to bet on risk and imaginary “stocks” ?! Absurd."
lxp36e4,You sound poor
lxp3gce,"Yes. Most people in the world, in America are. There’s absolutely nothing about being rich that t me. You don’t become rich without taking advantage of people below you and I don’t think money is so important to do that. I don’t think being rich is a flex whatsoever. It’s a sign of being a deeply fucked and shitty human being."
lxp7ocb, It's not about becoming rich to buy a lambo and brag that you're rich.  it's about using money to make more money to retire and actually enjoy life. A lot of jobs today do not have pensions. Putting your money in index funds and a roth IRA are a great ways to get your money working for you so you can have money when you can no longer work.  Not investing is risky. Two words - compound interest.
lxp86yo,"lol this world is going to cease to exist before most of us turn 55. Also I’m profoundly disabled so I’d rather have my money now than hope I can save it into retirement. 

It also shows you don’t work with the elderly because most of them have to sell off all the assets they do have to be able to afford elderly care — our system is fucked. My real money is staying right here with me and it, too, will burn with me when Climate Change finally gets us all."

lxp6h6m,"I agree that cryptocurrency is really dumb, but you absolutely can buy things with it. Why you would buy things with a security that is so volatile is beyond me.


That said, I've made a good amount of money investing in crypto. I basically take the approach of, wow this is dumb but I might as well take advantage of it. Just in the last couple weeks I've made like $10k of gains because of the ridiculous market. I make sure to dollar cost average out of crypto when it's skyrocketing like this because I know it will likely crash at some point soon like it always does. 


I absolutely do not trust crypto as a long term investment, so I take the profits and put them in index funds. When it crashes I typically invest a little more. It's a ridiculous cycle of profit..."
lxswt3e,So you purchase your goods and services with stock shares?
lxu2c1i,"Off the bat, crypto is garbage.

But this is not what the word 'scam' is. Cryptocurrency is not a scam. It's a highly speculative investment (let's call it gambling) which you can indeed buy some things with. I'm not sure why you would with such an incredibly volatile currency, but you can.

There are quite a number of scams that use crypto as part of the scam, but crypto itself is not a scam."

The biggest e-shop in my country accepts all kinds of crypto, and sells pretty much anything. So my crypto can buy me quite anything. And even if you don't have such e-shops available, you can always just sell a little bit on exchanges to buy stuff with fiat until crypto gets more adopted. Just holding it in the time between is still going to hedge you against inflation or possible fiat collapses.

Sure it's still quite immature and volatile at the moment, but in the long term (4+ years), it's value keeps going up against fiat."

These scammers are mainly impersonating us, calling customers and telling them that there's been fraudulent transactions on their account, and that they need to transfer their funds out to a safe account created in their name.

There's a system in the UK called 3D secure - its an approval method that requires you to manually approve any online transactions in your banking app before the payment is made, and it's a system that's required by law to mitigate these types of fraudulent payments.

These scammers will make online transactions for thousands and tell people to approve this in their app to transfer it over to a safer account. Couple this with a 'verification text' from a spoofed number and people will fall for it hook line and sinker 99% of the time.

Just remember if the bank calls you asking you to move funds anywhere, its not the bank and you should hang up straight away.

EDIT: Romance scams are also insanely common, and sometimes some of the saddest calls we take in CS.

These are when someone has been speaking to an individual online, usually for a number of years, and has grown an attachment or a relationship with this person, who has manipulated them into transferring their money over to them for family emergencies or hospital bills - quite often losing their life savings."

lxqwg6o,"Medicare Advantage. For real. Medicare is the best insurance I ever had. Advantage is just regular insurance companies taking the money you paid in during your work years as monthly payment to provide the normal very flawed insurance we in the U.S. are used to, which is to say they try their best not to pay if they can get away with it. I know insurance quite well having been disabled since age 5. I worked 40 years but am now retired. 

Even with ACA protections in place insurers try to keep from paying for services your doctor prescribes. Right now I have a pressure sore on my foot. My home health nursing supervisor who certifies my need each month told me recently if I had Advantage she would not be able to get service for me now that it's doing much better, regardless of the fact that the doctor and the nurses treating me say I still require treatment. In the past I've had sores reopen or become infected if treatment ends too soon.

Also when my dad was dying he had Medicare Advantage - because they hard sell with telemarketers using cold calls constantly and he was very vulnerable to that kind of tactic. (I got 3 calls Saturday.) He had terrible bed sores. But could not get home health for them through the Advantage program he was enrolled in. Fortunately he got some care through the VA. We private paid the rest. At the same time I had smaller better managed sores and was able to get Medicare coverage.

Before y'all without the experience jump in with your feelings about how people should not have terrible bed sores if they're being cared for properly: if you have poor circulation and are bedbound or can't move your lower extremities well you can get skin breakdown within a matter of hours even when you're actively trying not to. They will get worse without help. It is a constant battle, even with proper booties and mattress covers and turning and all the other methods of mitigating. Once it is an open sore it needs care and constant dressing changes to keep from becoming a serious problem. 

My sister was executor of my dad's estate because she's the eldest. It took nearly two years of constant battle to get Advantage to reimburse for his last month of care. And my sister is a formidable opponent in phone battles and paperwork wars. I have never once had to fight to get Medicare to pay for services that had already been approved and provided. Sometimes you need to wait a period of time to replace medical equipment but that is something you discuss during the approval process. Once approved it is promptly paid. And equipment replacement periods are quite reasonable.

Medicare Advantage is a straight up scam. And the ads you see telling old people ""you may be eligible for"" all kinds of outlandish extras are Advantage ads meant to draw you in. They bear no resemblance to actual coverage except under very extreme situations that most people never find themselves in. Like all U.S. health insurance it is great as hypothetical aid sometime in the future when you might be ill for a brief period of time. If you actually need that help they will find a reason you don't qualify or just flat out stall 2 years so you go on and die.

Finally, if you take an Advantage plan when you first qualify for Medicare while you are still healthy and it is all hypothetical, then you discover later it doesn't cover what you need you forever pay more for Medicare. And yes Medicare is insurance and you do pay for it monthly. It is just better less costly insurance because they are allowed to bargain down fee schedules."

lxqxwzm,"Political parties.

The number of people trying to form “the resistance” or bitching about trump 24/7 is laughable.  The Democrats wouldn’t piss on you if you were on fire.

That’s somewhat matched with the crowd looking for retribution or spiking the ball thinking that voters gave trump a mandate for everything.  They didn’t.

The fact is that elections get won in the middle by people that don’t pay attention or support anything that any candidate says.  They’re usually referendums on how good/bad the people in charge are doing.  Just because people overwhelmingly thought that Biden did shitty doesn’t mean we going full project 2025.

The other fact is that no politician gives a fuck about you (no, really, they don’t give a shit).  To them, you’re something they have to endure, to put up with, to suffer through.  They need you to go out and vote once an election cycle and they bullshit you the rest of the time.  

The result is people like you and I fighting with each other, them remaining in office where they enrich themselves and try to get grift jobs and careers for their friends and family.

On top of this, the bible is interpreted differently by each individual who reads it, or each Church that may 'present' it differently. For example, one sect of Christianity / Church may now have issues with certain life styles, whereas others see that same lifestyle as an utter sin. 

Edit : ""Life Style"" can be interpreted to whatever you want it to mean..... Just like the bible.

Dont get me wrong though, I have no hate for the bible or religion. If you choose to follow that path, I will not try to persuade you otherwise. I just have issues with people convincing themselves that God has spoken too them and that this is a reason they are causing harm to others."

lxpg27x,"Dozens of women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct dating back to the 1970s, and he has been found liable in court for sexual abuse. Several women have described Trump forcibly reaching under their skirts, others said he kissed them without consent, and a handful of beauty pageant contestants claimed Trump inappropriately walked in on them in changing rooms. In total, about two dozen women have spoken out publicly to accuse Trump:

Jessica Leeds told The New York Times in 2016 that, in the late 1970s, Trump, who was a stranger to her, reached his hand up her skirt and grabbed her breasts on a flight to New York. She said he “was like an octopus” and his “hands were everywhere” before she fled to the back of the plane. 

Ivana Trump, Trump’s first wife, accused him in a divorce deposition of raping her in a fit of rage in 1989, when they were married. She later said that she hadn’t meant in a “literal or criminal sense.” 

Kristin Anderson, a photographer and former model, told The Washington Post in 2016 that Trump sat next to her at a nightclub in the early 1990s and reached under her skirt. Anderson said the incident lasted about 30 seconds, but she and her friends were “very grossed out and weirded out.” 

Two weeks before the 2024 election, Stacey Williams told the Guardian that she met Trump in 1992 through Jeffrey Epstein, who later became a registered sex offender, was charged with sex trafficking and died by suicide in 2019. Epstein suggested the two visit Trump in Trump Tower in New York in 1993, Williams said, and shortly after they arrived, Trump groped her breasts and her butt. The Trump campaign denied the allegation.

Jill Harth, who worked with Trump in the 1990s, accused him of “attempted rape” in a 1997 complaint. She said that in 1993, Trump tried to kiss her in his daughter’s bedroom at his Mar-a-Lago resort, pushing her against a wall and putting his hand up her dress. She dropped the suit a few weeks after filing it, she said as part of a settlement with Trump in a separate breach of contract case, according to the Associated Press.

Lisa Boyne, a health food business entrepreneur, told HuffPost in 2016 that she attended a dinner with Trump in 1996 where several women were forced to walk across a table while Trump looked up their skirts and commented on their underwear and bodies. “It was the most offensive scene I’ve ever been a part of,” Boyne said. 

Five former Miss Teen USA contestants told BuzzFeed News in 2016 that in 1997, Trump, the owner of the pageant at the time, unexpectedly walked into the contestants’ dressing room while they were changing, which they found inappropriate. Mariah Billado said she rushed to put on her dress and remembered him saying, “Don’t worry ladies, I’ve seen it all before.” Victoria Hughes said that it was “the most inappropriate time to meet us all for the first time. The youngest girl was 15, and I was the eldest at 19.” The other three women described a similar situation to BuzzFeed anonymously; however, 11 others said they did not recall seeing Trump in the dressing room at all. 

In an April 2005 interview on The Howard Stern Show, when asked about Miss USA and Miss Universe, Trump said he would go backstage before beauty pageant shows, the only man in the room while the women were “standing there with no clothes.” As the owner, “I sort of get away with things like that,” he added. He was not asked about Miss Teen USA in this interview.

E. Jean Carroll, a writer, said Trump raped her in 1996 in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room. Carroll wrote about the incident in her 2019 memoir called “What Do We Need Men For?” In May 2023, Carroll was awarded $5 million after a jury held Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation, though not rape. 

Temple Taggart, former Miss Utah, told The New York Times in 2016 that Trump “kissed me directly on the lips” when he met her at the 1997 Miss USA pageant and again when she met with him in Manhattan after he offered to help with her modeling career. Taggart described the incident as “inappropriate” and said her first thought after he kissed her was, “Oh my God, gross.” 

Cathy Heller told The Guardian in 2016 that Trump forcibly kissed her when she attended a Mother’s Day brunch at Mar-a-Lago in the 1990s. Heller said she was “angry and shaken” after the former president ignored her handshake, grabbed her and went for the lips and became angry when she tried to turn her head away. 

Amy Dorris, a former model, said Trump forcibly kissed and groped her in his private box at the U.S. Open tennis championship in 1997. Dorris told The Guardian in 2020 that Trump “shoved his tongue down my throat” and “his hands were very gropey and all over my butt, my breasts, my back, everything.” 

Karena Virginia, a yoga instructor and life coach, told The Washington Post in 2016 that Trump groped her, unexpectedly wrapping his arm around her and touching her breast, in 1998 while she waited for a car outside the U.S. Open.

Karen Johnson, who was a regular at Mar-a-Lago, said Trump pulled her behind a tapestry to kiss and grope her during a New Year’s Eve party in the early 2000s. Johnson detailed the incident to journalists Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy, who published it in their 2019 book, “All the President’s Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator,” along with 42 other allegations of sexual misconduct.

Bridget Sullivan, another former Miss USA contestant, told BuzzFeed News in 2016 that she met Trump at a party promoting the competition, and he hugged her “a little low on your back” and gave “a squeeze that your creepy uncle would.” In a separate instance in 2000, Sullivan said, Trump walked backstage while many of the contestants were naked or getting dressed.

Tasha Dixon, a former Miss USA contestant, told CBS in 2016 that, in 2001, Trump walked into where she and other contestants were changing. Dixon said she thought Trump “owned the pageant for the reasons to utilize his power to get around beautiful women.”

Melinda McGillivray told the Palm Beach Post in 2016 that Trump grabbed her butt without her consent in 2003 when they were backstage at a Ray Charles concert at Mar-a-Lago. 

Natasha Stoynoff, a former reporter for People magazine, wrote in 2016 that Trump sexually assaulted her in 2005 while she was visiting Mar-a-Lago to work on a story about his first year of marriage with Melania. When they were alone, Stoynoff said, Trump closed the door and pushed her against the wall before “forcing his tongue down my throat.” 

Juliet Huddy, a former Fox News anchor, said on the “Mornin!!! With Bill Schulz” podcast in 2017 that Trump kissed her unexpectedly and without her consent in Trump Tower in the mid-2000s. Huddy said she “didn’t feel threatened” at the time but later realized she would’ve said no more clearly. 

Rachel Crooks, a former receptionist at Trump Tower, told The New York Times in 2016 that Trump kissed her “directly on the mouth” without consent when she first met him in 2005. 

Samantha Holvey, a former Miss USA contestant, told CNN in 2016 that when she competed in 2006, Trump personally inspected each contestant, looking at them from head to toe like “sexual objects,” which made her feel “the dirtiest I felt in my entire life.” 

Ninni Laaksonen, a model and former Miss Finland, in 2016 told Ilta-Sanomat, a Finnish newspaper, that Trump squeezed her butt in 2006 when they were backstage at the “Late Show with David Letterman.” 

Jessica Drake, an actor in adult films, accused Trump during a 2016 news conference of grabbing her, kissing her without her consent and offering her $10,000 to come to his penthouse hotel room in 2006. 

Summer Zervos, a former contestant on “The Apprentice,” told reporters at a 2016 news conference that Trump sexually assaulted her on two separate occasions in 2007. The first was when she met him and he kissed her on the lips. Later that year, Zervos said Trump grabbed her shoulder, kissed her “aggressively,” placed his hand on her breast and thrust himself on her before she was able to pull away and leave the room. 

Cassandra Searles, a former Miss USA contestant, wrote in a 2016 Facebook post that Trump “continually grabbed my ass and invited me to his hotel room” when she competed in 2013. 

Alva Johnson, a former campaign staff member, alleged in a 2019 lawsuit that Trump grabbed her hand and kissed her on the side of the mouth without her consent during a rally in 2016.

lxridfo,Lol. He didn't reply. Odd.
lxtvfz2,Odd that none of that is proof. Where's the conviction and jail sentence?
lxucnvz,"Right. So I guess those 34 felony convictions for stealing highly classified documents, keeping them in a golf course tool shed, repeatedly lying about having them, and repeatedly refusing to give them back. You definitely accept those as proof then. Right?

Because, he was convicted of those felonies. So, obviously, as you afore mentioned, you do accept those as proof of a crime. 

I mean, it would be super hypocritical and it show a complete lack of any intellectual honesty if you were to then come up with some bullshit excuse for him for crimes of which he was convicted. You know, since you claim ""lack of a conviction""  as an excuse for his other crimes. 

Only a complete idiot and a total piece of miserable worthless shit would do that, which I can only assume you are not. Therefore, I'm certain you personally consider him totally responsible for those felonies, of which he has been convicted, as well as all other felonies of which he has been, or will be convicted in a court of law. And I'm sure that you will join in being outaged if he does not go to prison for his crimes. 

So good to know there's good, fair minded people out there who set a consistent standard that holds everyone to account. Calling balls and strikes. Never moving the goal post. Good for you. /s"

Michael Jackson was also accused of child molestation but settled to avoid a costly court battle. Many people believe he was targeted for his money and that's generally accepted but he was also loved by many. Trump however is a demon so every accusation is real right? 

Now, show me proof where it was investigated and he was convicted of rape. Then I'll accept that he was a rapist. Just like every citizen in this country, innocent until proven guilty.

There's no proof here. Just women bringing up stuff many years after it supposedly happened while using for money. Little suspicious there."

Most Scientologists, are normal people, that work right next to you, and you’d never know unless they told you. They’ve just been duped in to thinking that Scientology is going to save the world, and the only way that they can make that a reality is every Scientologist participates fully. 

I had some genuine gains in Scientology but for the most part I had to feign my gains, so that I wouldn’t get hit with a declare of some kind. I’d be willing to bet that the vast majority of them do the same, because the deeper in to it you get the more friends and family you have to lose."

Consider rent-a-center, which has a ""Samsung 50"" The Frame QLED 4K Smart TV"" which you can rent-to-own for only $10 plus $39.99 per week! And after 87 weekly payments, it's yours to keep!

Except when you do the math, that works out to $3,489.13 worth of payments over about 20 months. Meanwhile, you could just buy that TV today directly off your favorite retailor for $749.99. If you got a loan today for that $750, and had to pay $3,489.13 over 20 months for that loan, you'd be paying *over 200% interest per year*. That's highway robbery.

If you were EVER going to consider this, just put the $750 TV on a credit card, that's even a better decision."

Generally speaking what’s interesting is that Al modern fraud still relies on the same principles of fraud from hundreds of years ago - and that people are still not taught the principles at any point well enough not to fall victims.

At the core you still have “advance fee” fraud which is 90% of what people fall victim to, so if I can do anything of value I’d say to people here: learn what advance fee fraud is and have it in mind whenever money changes hands.

At the core it’s when someone wants you to give them money before they give you money or goods: on Facebook marketplace it’s always “I want to buy the item you posted. Can you pay the courier by transfer/cash/buy the post label via this link” or some shit like that. On real-estate fraud it would be putting a deposit to secure a viewing of a (non-existent) apartment, or some variation of it.

Marketplace fraud is when someone sells you something that doesn’t exist, so that’s just about buying from safer vendors and using insured transfer methods rather than bank transfer or whatever else.

Advance fee fraud is the oldest trick in the book. Do not fall for it. Shit, I fought scams for nearly 20 years and I still need to be in complete awareness when I trade anything online. Be careful."

I get spam calls for someone else, the person who had my phone number before me, presumably. This makes me very happy, so long as they aren't frequent, because it means the scam callers don't know anything about me. I'll worry a little the day they start using any name anything remotely like mine.

But every single time the call has one of two or three identifiable voices, it uses a *very* bad machine voice for the recipient so you know it's prefab, and it uses dumb, *deeply* unprofessional terms like ""the cops"" rather than ""law enforcement."" The very first time I heard one of these I was mildly concerned, but its scam nature became obvious very quickly. By now I must have gotten hundreds of the exact same scam calls. So....apparently *some* people still fall for it? But I honestly can't believe how brazen they are about repeating it literally identically for over 10 years."

Despite being around for years, scammers continue to convince people that there's something wrong with their computer by posing as tech support representatives from reputable companies like Microsoft or Apple.

They'll often make unsolicited calls or display pop-up messages claiming that your device is infected with a virus. The scammer will then urge the victim to grant remote access to their computer or pay for unnecessary software or services. It's shocking because many people are aware of these scams, yet they persist, especially targeting those who may be less tech-savvy.

What’s really surprising is how convincing these scammers can be—they use legitimate-sounding jargon and fake caller IDs to impersonate real companies, preying on people’s fears of losing data or compromising their devices.

They have coins minted for their own company. You can't shop them around. They claim they are premium coin and you get more than the spot bullion price because it has a collectible value.

There is NO market for these coins and they sell for the melt value anywhere else. You can't shop them out, dealers don't want them. They sell for 3-4 times the common spot prices of recognized coins like American Eagles.

If they have to sell, it goes back to the company dealer they bought them for. Almost always at a loss from original purchase.


These companies, are organized con men designed to face the elderly. There's no regulations or licenses. Some  just outright steal the money like Oxford Gold or Regal Assets and shut the doors.

There’d be a bunch of boxes in the boot of the car and when people came up, one of the guys would grab one, open it, and show them the iPad in it. People would then give them money (a very small amount for an iPad) and one of the guys would grab another box from the pile and hand it to the customer. The customer would then walk off and the guys would drive away. Of course, there were no iPads in any of the boxes except for the one the guys were using to demonstrate. How come nobody noticed the weight differences between an empty box and a box with an iPad? Each box had a tile or something similar in it.

I assume people must have thought the iPads were stolen and that’s why they were going cheap, only to then get ripped off."
lxra09h,"Like two weeks ago one of  my bosses fell for the most obvious fedex scam right in front of me and I pretty much stopped her and saved her job. This dude called saying he was from fedex and they can’t deliver our most recent shipment because the payment didn’t go through and he’d need a one time payment of $68k and to take that in cash to a bitcoin ATM. I heard her talking on the phone with the guy saying we don’t have that much cash and he was saying “oh well gather as much as you can and we can use that as a down payment” and she was getting all the money out of the registers and the safe which was probably less than $10k and I was like “wait, wtf are you doing???” And she explained and I was like stop you are being scammed. She was literally halfway out the door with bank bags full of money and it really made me question her intelligence and kinda made me wonder how tf she’s MY boss."

And I STILL didn't figure it out!

My dumb self thought the court messed up somewhere and that I had the ticket. Then I got a second letter for more because I didn't pay the 1st. So I went down to the courthouse and requested a court date. Because I couldn't pay the 1st one if I wanted to. Because no one could find it. 

Plus, please explain what this ticket is even for. The picture is at night. I can barely make out ""my car"", and the description of the infraction somehow doesn't explain what I did. 

Anyway, the other day, someone posted the exact same picture in my cities reddit page asking if it was a scam, and it absolutely is. And if I hadn't lost the scam paper, I probably would have paid it and never thought twice about it."

lxtxp98,"I’m blown away when I see people blindly sharing missing persons posts on social media that have absolutely no information about the person missing. These posts are usually made by someone posing as a family member of the missing to create a fake emergency situation in order to collect bogus donations. Usually the posts go from 0-100 in the blink of an eye. For instance, a post went viral in the city I live in a few weeks ago where an adult woman and her friend (late teens / early 20s) were picked up by “2 trusted men in a pickup” and haven’t been seen since”. The post then said “I believe it’s sex trafficking” even though the girls had only been gone for less than a day. 

Why did this seem scammy? Because the post was missing all of the following: The full name of the girl’s friend that was also missing, the description of the two trusted men, the description of their pickup, the full description of both girls, defining markings / tattoos, last known location, things that would actually help the community find these two girls. There was literally nothing in the post that actually gave the community any info on who was actually missing. The original poster would constantly delete then repost the same thing over and over once too many people asked questions that the person posting couldn’t answer. To top it off, the post had just one picture closeup of the two girls and that was it; no individual shots, no full body pics, no flood of information a loved one would put out there who’s looking to their community for assistance. Within 48 hours, the post had been shared thousands upon thousands of times across multiple states but at no point was any of the pertinent information given in any of these posts."

Same with other modern day life like constant exposure to screens, bombarded with ads and consumerism, spending a lot of time indoors, relying on technology to do everything for us, etc etc etc. 

Basically we don’t use our bodies and brains as they’re built to be used. The desire to make survival less daunting has led us to turn into solitary creatures of comfort. Hyper individualism makes us lonely, depressed and anxious. We are social creatures that thrive on community and being active. Nature has pretty much everything we need, and we don’t have that knowledge like we used to. Our dopamine is also completely jacked up, making us less and less inclined to take care of ourselves in healthy ways. Physical exertion, providing for ourselves, serving each other in communities, having more time for pleasure and hobbies and socializing, this is how our ancestors experienced dopamine. It all works almost like a system, where our brain is getting a steady flow of dopamine. Compare to today, we are overwhelmed, tired, overworked, lonely, addicted to internet… our dopamine takes a big hit and crashes, making us feel bad, making us cope in unhealthy ways like endless scrolling, binge eating, smoking, drinking, hours of tv, etc just to get that immediate dopamine hit. 

I promise I’m not one of those paranoid conspiracy theorists or some hippy telling you to move to the woods and drink raw milk. I do love a lot of other aspects of modern life, like modern medicine and  all that, I just think power and greed has steered humans so beyond off course from what our bodies and minds are capable of and ways to spend our time that make us feel good and give us a purpose. Working 50 hours a week just to be able to barely have free time with our families, barely able to afford our mortgages and cars and insurance and bills and processed junk food, it’s all a way to keep consumerism and capitalism going. That is not a purpose, that’s straight up a scam."

[https://www.amazon.com/Check-Your-Financial-Privilege-Gladstein/dp/B09V2NM9VJ](https://www.amazon.com/Check-Your-Financial-Privilege-Gladstein/dp/B09V2NM9VJ)

>Alex Gladstein has a lot to say about Bitcoin, human rights, financial privilege, and personal freedom. In Check Your Financial Privilege, he says it, starting with the fact that anyone born into a reserve currency like the euro, yen, or pound has financial privilege over the 89% of the world population born into weaker systems.

>In Nigeria, human rights activists depend on Bitcoin for donations after crackdowns by authoritarian regimes. In Cuba, after a dual-currency system devalued the peso, those who saved in Bitcoin managed to stay afloat. In El Salvador, where remittance fees and exchange rates can eat away a simple money transfer to family members in need, Bitcoin offers hope with lower fees and faster transactions (and now it's legal tender).

>As CSO of the Human Rights Foundation, Gladstein is uniquely positioned to detail the rise of Bitcoin from cypherpunk dream to the real-life Bitcoin stories happening to real people across the globe. For people around the world, outside of Wall Street, Bitcoin offers a means of freedom from inflation, political strife, and an outdated monetary system. For these people, the majority of the world’s population, it might even save their lives.

 They promise the world, then when voted in, they don't come through on promises. They'll blame former republican presidents and gaslight their followers by way of the leftist media they own.

 They especially love to do this with the disenfranchised and minorities. They'll say anything and flip any position to achieve their goals. 

Total scam. Luckily, the people have woken up to this as seen in this year's election."
lxrmdil,This take blatantly ignores the purposefully-obstructionist Congress doing their damnedest to make sure that Democrats get nothing done so that the GOP/MAGA can complain about Democrats getting nothing done.
lxpi8j4,"I don’t think that’s a nuanced take.

The truth is, sometimes they legitimately don’t have the amount of seats they need in Congress to get things passed. Biden passed BBB and the Inflation Reduction Act, but he had to make concessions because low turnout prevented him from getting the votes he needed right off the rip.

There’s nuance here. If you pay attention to what’s going on in Congress, you can clearly see that Democrats are *really* trying their hardest to fulfill their promises, while Republicans do literally everything and anything they can to stop them."
lxrvdoy,better than voting for a rapist and pedophile
lxspaui,"Democrats aren't leftists. They're centrists: And whether or not what they want to do is good (it's usually fine, if not a bit underwhelming), the reason they can never get anything done is because you people keep putting Republican contrarians in their way that block legislation. Or, when a Democrat president does a bunch of good, you all just kinda go ""lalalala can't hear you! Socialist! Communist! Liberal agenda!"" until a Republican president can come along and fuck it up again, at which point you somehow blame the Democrats, or simply lie to yourselves and say everything is fine.

I *wish* we had some left-wing representation. I'm sick of candidates who expect my vote but still try to pander to conservatives. I was happy to vote for Kamala Harris this year, but she lost a *ton* of left-wing support by staying too centrist, especially on certain issues. The big part is remaining ultimately pro-Israel (and therefore condoning the Palestinian genocide) which is a right-wing stance that too many leftists just couldn't abide by. Now, those leftists are still idiots for allowing the *worse* option to win—the guy who wants to help ""finish the job""—but morally, I understand their reasoning. It's a big and unfortunate example of what *always* happens when a Democrat becomes President: the right does what they do and slanders them to high hell, and the left grows too apathetic and frustrated to vote pragmatically. It sucks. Especially sucks that it happened in this election of all elections, when so much is at stake, both here and abroad. Damn shame. I can only hope the reluctant Trump-voters are right in predicting that it ""won't be that bad,"" but I remember his first term and I know what's changed. My hopes are not high this time around."

Did you think that would offend me or something? I'm more offended by the idiocy of the attempt, but really it's just kind of sad. Do better. Maybe address something I said next time.

Oh, and as a little cherry on top, just to fact check, he said that in 2008—years *before* he openly spoke of the ruling of Obergefell v. Hodges as ""a victory."" It's almost like he 1) believed something problematic and then grew as a person over several years (which we should commend someone, especially a politician, for doing), or even 2) simply said the wrong thing because he wasn't thinking. Worst case scenario, he pandered to conservatives, which I already told you I disapprove of and which *doesn't matter because I don't revere the guy as a saint.* He was just... a president. Relatively good one, as presidents go, but he was no messiah. In any case, I'm not gonna lose sleep about something a former President—from a party with which I don't align myself—said in a speech over 15 years ago... when I was in grade school.

But I got scammed a different way one time a year ago.
I was texting my friend, then I got a DM from someone saying ""I'm so, so sorry, I accidentally reported your STEAM account. I'm sorry! I thought I mass reported someone else! I meant to click the person under you in ____ server! I'm sorry! (They sent a screenshot)."" Look, I know. It's STUPID, but I fell for it. It didn't Dawn on me thinking (they have to do . multiple clicks to even report me. So, how did they do that and not notice???) Until my bf pointed it out. 

Anyways, then they said something about adding someone to my friends on discord to help me, saying they were working for steam. (Me not knowing that steam doesn't use discord or anything, didn't know better, so I did it) then they sent me a confirmation to my email to change my password. I don't know how, because I don't remember clicking ""reset"", but they got into my steam. I got it back, steam helped me instantly. Oh, BUT ON DISCORD I WAZ LAUGHING because I annoyed tf outta the steam ""mod"" (which had a bot logo, pretending to be a bot) and if i took tooooo long to reply, they got mad..but when i replied, I said stupid shit to annoy them cause I was pissed.

Also my brother got scammed and some dude took his discord account, and my bestie told me he can't get it back because he's never had nitro or anything. He's smart and knows discord, but IDK. My brother clicked on a link then was signed out he said.

Knowing that, they hide it out of shame which is exactly the reason these scams are the way they are. 

It is not about not getting caught or getting as many people as possible, it is about the people you got hide it as long as possible from their superiors, their IT, etc... 

This is much more valuable for the scammer and the exact reason why you help the scammers if you shame victims or make fun of them. The next victim you may prevent from doing what he has to do after getting scammed: Reporting it to people that can get them out or lessen the damage."

I still can't believe he fell for it, especially after I read the texts between them and asked him to explain the entirety of their ""relationship.""

Classic signs of romance-for-monetary-gain manipulation:

\- In the beginning, spoke to him every day, flirting a lot, made him fall in love quickly, overly sexual to rope him in.

\- Wouldn't get into an official relationship with him until some court proceedings happened first between her and her ex and their mutual child.

\- Started her scam by asking money for small things (to gain his trust, of course).

\- Started asking for bigger things like lawyer fees to help expedite the process of them being together.

\- Used her child to emotionally manipulate him into helping her with the court money by stating the ex abused her and the child.

\- Hung out with him a couple times IN REAL LIFE. But always made an excuse not to be intimate, hug, cuddle, fuck, et cetera. She lived 4 hours away from him in another state.

\- After he was hooked, she would make excuses as to her phone being shut off, needing more money for that, and only texted him on the days he got paid. Basically kept being romantic a couple times a week and strung him along just enough to keep getting his paychecks. Minimal effort, maximum reward.

When I got the exact same call, I told her not to worry about it. The person who was attempting to scam us was clearly unaware of the laws, because the recorded message was *only* in English.

That said, I knew the psychology and the reason it was so obvious- they needed to target only the most naive of people, so sending emails that were so clearly too good to be true, meant they would get responses from only the people most likely to fall for the whole thing.

Now it was okay, because most of them had trust funds and would end up in law school if they couldn't find a job at daddy's line of work.  Many of them would then go find some interesting work to do.

You can’t get out of these and they usually don’t ever provide what they say they will in there presentations.  They will lie to your face over and over again.  Then you feel “pressured to sign” and the document has a completely different set of terms than you were told.  

I sat in on 2 different presentations in my life.   What was supposed to be a 2 hour presentation was each time over 4 hours and they hold you hostage as in both cases they picked us up from a hotel and brought us to this fancy resort and wined and dined us.   I made it clear that I would need to have a lawyer and my accountant look over the terms and they wouldn’t let me take a copy of the documents.  Each time I got something out of it. At least they were honest there.  In Mexico I got a week paid for rental car and 100 bucks cash.  The one in Florida we got 300 bucks cash.   My ex at the time would have signed if I hadn’t been there!  She was so sold on it.  That’s how I know how easy it is for people to fall for these. She was very smart but fell for it.

I told my father to hang up.  He didn’t want to be rude to the guy on the other end.  I yelled at my father “Hang up!”  If I didn’t happen to be visiting my father’s at the time who knows how far the scammer would have gotten.  My father is financially savvy and I find it surprising he doesn’t realize these e-mails are scams. "

I'm not talking about your avarage person, the placebo effect is real (especially when it concerns pain management), but there's an actual pharmacist in my town that went to uni for 6 years and tried to give me homeopathy in stead of the anti viral meds my doctor prescribed. These are for genital herpes (got it from a stupid cold sore, not even the fun way...). Fevers during these attacks can be so high they can cause brain damage. 'take this tablet made of a chemical sugar replacement and chemically extracted lactose from milk that's been doused by magically shaken water, it's all natural in stead of that chemical crap'...

There's nothing natural or herbal about homeopathy, it's a pseudo science that relies on the belief of water molecules having 'memory'. It's esoteric (like tarot cards and ear candles), not herbal (like using eucalyptus to free up your nose).

I hate it when people who are actually smart themselves call homeopathy herbal, most regular medicine contain more natural ingredients than those tablets."

People advertise on Facebook and other social media for anyone that has a checking account with a debit card. They target people who have little or no money in their  accounts, especially college students. They then get the person with the debit card to give it to them along with the PIN number. Then they deposit a fake check into the account and use the debit card at an ATM to withdraw the money immediately. The person who owns the checking account reports the card stolen and the person who deposited the fake check gives them part of the money as a kickback.

The “loophole” apparently exists in every single contract. Let me also add, that my neighbor’s vehicle was a lease yet he still believed this bullshit. Anyway, a year later, our neighbor couldn’t believe that he still hadn’t received his car title and money back. Then the “friend” ghosted him."

They did have a date of my doctor visit, but i also had a payment made to the portal already from that day (For a different amount, through the portal) Ended up telling them to fuck off. Its been months now so I'm sue it was a scam.

When I was around 20 or so, some distant relative I hardly ever spoke to who was a little older than me tried to get me to join one, saying it’s a “family business” and they wanted me to be a part of it. He really tried convincing me to come to a “family meeting” to discuss it more. I am so proud of the fact that 20 year old me was very suspicious. These were some relatives I would’ve loved to reconnect with, but the situation just gave me a weird feeling. And I was a timid person at that age who had a hard time saying no to people. Thank goodness I did.

Later had an uncle (from a different side of the family) trying to get me to join his wife’s MLM scheme. Rejected that “opportunity” as well.

Oh, also rejected an old coworkers MLM.

Maybe I just saw through the scheme? It always shocked me how easily people fell for these - some of them being older people I respected. And at 20 or so, I had better judgement."

The lady on the phone told me that I had been selected for a federal grant for something like $20k to help pay for my school. I just needed to provide my bank account number and routing number so they could transfer the money to me directly.

Being naive, poor, and excited, I provided the information. Once I hung up, it only took a few minutes to get a sinking feeling that maybe that was not legit and that maybe I had just given my bank account information to someone with malicious intent. Huge facepalm moment.

First thing the next morning, I went to my bank, closed out that account, and opened a new one. Luckily they hadn't done anything yet, but if common sense hadn't taken over, I would have been screwed."

Without double checking with the owners or anything, dude just empties the safe and does exactly that. Couple thousand dollars spent on Visa cards and given to these random dudes who said they were corporate.

The manager is someone I think is pretty intelligent and was thought everyone was pranking me when they told me what happened. I’m buddies w the manager and we hang out outside of work so I wasn’t going to press it but what the actual fuck was going through his mind?

If corporate showed up in person and asked me to do that shit I’d say hell nah I ain’t holding all your money and being a walking lick for anyone to rob me.

Can you say for definite and without question that if you go to another country and without trying the local delicacy that the food will be disgusting?

Yes, there are real scams out there but the vast majority have a system in place that like MLM or Network Marketing that do work but people who don't understand it or even attempted it, the first thing they will say, without further thought, it is a pyramid scheme. 

These people still think an employment hierarchy is not a pyramid scheme even though it's shaped like a pyramid just like in MLM and Network Marketing. They see it and accept it as the only way because they've been programmed through education and their environment to accept it this way from their early years to adulthood.

If you don't know what it is you're basically called on the phone, or messaged online, by people claiming to be from microsoft tech support who need to fix your computer to protect you from some major security vulnerability, or even claiming that you've been hacked already and they'll fix it. They walk you through installing a remote access tool on your computer and then open up a bunch of fake websites made to look legit and pretending they're working. Then they tell you to check your bank account to make sure hackers haven't managed to get your money, bid you a good day, and hang up. If and when you log into your bank account, they'll swipe your credentials with their access tool which remains in your PC, and they steal as much money as they can get.

When I say I know people who fell for it I don't mean elderly people who don't know any better, I mean grown ass adults in their mid 20s who have been using computers since the mid 2000s and should really know better than that. One of them lost 4,5k and only managed to recover a third of that. The rest was gone, poof."

lxx95jh,"XRVAP is a crappy, cheap steam cleaning machine that hires people with no qualifications, other than a driver’s license, to sell it. Doesn’t sound that bad, right?

The machine costs $4500 USD and looks like it was designed in the 80s. You can easily find something better for $200.

Here’s the deal:

* ""Employees"" have to buy the machine before they can sell it.
* They have to memorize a script and can’t deviate from it.
* They’re pushed to target their family and friends.
* They’re only paid on commission.
* There’s a program that tries to lure clients in, where if you arrange a few meetings with your friends, you earn points for stuff like “free” theme park tickets.
* If you call a friend and book a meeting right now, your points turn into “kangaroo” points and double (wtf?).

Basically, they scam people with low incomes and no education into spending their last savings on a cheap machine.

It also seems like a shady pyramid scheme because my girlfriend’s nephew told us that if we didn’t sign right away, but waited until the next day, his superior would get a bigger commission on the sale.

It looks like someone bought a huge stock of those unsold crappy machines after the original manufacturer bankrupted and rebranded them.

Scratched the back off of them, gave the guy on the phone the codes on the back and numbers.  Then they told him to mail them to the IRS.  I went to the collection box he put them in and found the envelopes.  Was sending them to the actual IRS address and they told him to write something where the stamp would go.  I was just thinking how dumb can you be.

You pay real money to put on a ledger that you own a fraction of a monopoly paper. People assume there's this 'demand' that floats the valuation. but most of bitcoin is owned by 10 holders. If the big players got in at 1k or less then they have vast multiples of value by only selling a tenth of their holdings. It doesn't matter if another coin never sells again. Its not a stock that's tied to a real company's performance or anything. Nothing stops the big players from holding to keep a high value or trading between each other to fake activity.

At least with a bank, there's some vault with tangible assets people will value even in a huge recession.

lxvnw1j,"fiat money is juist as made up, money is abstract number to do exchanges, and bitcoin provides that mechanism, and digital scarcity, that ensured it cannot be printed into infinity like fiat can. This scarcity makes it behave more like a physical object than digital data, as digital data can be copies, but bitcoin cannot, it can only be moved around. There are markets for crypto that provide it with value by supply vs demand. There are identical blockchains where the coins have no value, they only differ by having a free faucet to make infinite coins, therefore breaking the scarcity, they are called testnets as they are useful for testing features without financial cost. Real bitcoin mainnet doesn't haver afaucet so its 21M coins are all there will ever be, and that gives them value, because you can only buy them, and not copy them or create any more than the mined ones (that cost energy to mine, not free) for yourself out of thin air.

I guess you just don't understand that much about what it is and that gives you that Dunning-Kruger confidence in ""knowing"" its a scam. It's just a finite unforgeable asset usable for storing value without inflation and for payments."

Way back when my husband and I could barely afford our new mtg, (we live in California) we had three extra bedrooms, nice House. So we got roommates. 

One of them was a sweet, college educated, but not street smart girl, wide-eyed, fresh from Wyoming.  She mets a real nice guy that's as naive as she was. 

One day we came in from work and they're both there, all excited. Says they have to talk to us, it's important. So we go change, come back to the living room, and they're both waiting. 

She proceeded to give us her presentation. Amway. She had done actual spread sheets calculating what the household collectively spent on everyday items, and demanded to know what we spent on everything from shampoo to window cleaner.

Then he pulled out the Amway catalog, and started showing us what great products we ""will be using from now on."" OK then! 

We felt really bad about bursting her bubble. She was invincible. Would not stop, getting very aggressive, ""why wouldn't you want to save all this money???""

But then, she goes a bridge too far*. Husband asks her where is she going to put all this inventory she's going to need? 

In our garage. Husband doesn't need to park there, she's already figured out the sq footage that was needed, and it was only half the garage. We just needed to move some stuff. I could see my husbands' eyes narrow, and he began his own presentation.(Usually a calm redheaded musician).

No way, uh,uh, no. Hell no. She wants to know why, he says he owns the garage. She says, well she pays rent. He says, go read your contract, show me where it says you have access to the garage unless granted by the homeowners, us. 

I felt so bad for the two of them, but they just wouldn't give it up. We started raising their rent until they finally gave notice. I don't know what became of them, but I had to give them credit, if any one was going to make it to the Platinum Club, it was them."

It's by far one of the most toxic scams in America that has been disproven everyday since it was theorized. Yet millions of people get conned by right-wing media and politicians into giving CEOs and mega business owners all these tax cuts so they can make even more obscene wealth while you struggle to buy eggs and cars and a home. 

It's fucking tragic watching so many people destroy their own futures with a vote."

lxsjahn,"Bras. Society pushes this idea that bras are somehow essential for women’s bodies, claiming they offer 'support' and 'prevent sagging,' but these are just myths created by companies looking to profit. There’s no real scientific evidence that bras benefit breast health or appearance—in fact, they can actually cause harm by weakening natural support and limiting circulation. They’re uncomfortable, often expensive, and entirely unnecessary.

And when it comes to health risks, people like to point to the 2014 Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center study to 'prove' bras don’t cause cancer. But that study is flawed. It was short-term, with a small participant pool, and it didn’t look at essential factors like bra fit, wear duration, or physiological impacts. Plus, it relied heavily on self-reported data, which is often unreliable. So really, the claim that bras are harmless doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. The idea that women 'need' to wear bras is a scam, pushed by an industry preying on insecurities. Our bodies are perfectly designed as they are!"

lxpz66s,"Lazy answer: Trumpism.

Less lazy answer: Online or on-app romance scams. I once talked to someone who wanted me to help him get back $40,000 that he'd paid over the course of a year to a lawyer and a travel agent, to get his girlfriend immigration status from Korea. A very short consultation revealed that he had never met this girlfriend in person, or any of these professionals who, he was assured, could help bring her to him; nor was there any reliable documentation of the money he'd given them. He was not happy at the suggestion that there probably was no lawyer, no travel agent, no girlfriend in Korea, and no way to get this money back, months after the fact. 

It happened to a friend of mine, too: she was at one point excitedly talking about her new girlfriend, who she'd met over Tinder, and who was going to come stay with her. I thought it was a real thing. Until she then learned that this woman was a ""jewelry dealer"" of some sort, and was detained in Russia, because the Russian government had seized her stock, and she needed to pay $20,000 to corrupt officials to get it back... and then she confessed, no, she'd never actually met this person with her face. I had to gently break it to her that she probably did not have a girlfriend, she probably had a scam problem. My friend is not stupid. She just wanted it to be true."
